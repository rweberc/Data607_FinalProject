Tony Kim was detained at Pyongyang's airport in April 2017 and accused of unspecified ""hostile acts"" against the regime. He taught accounting at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. Kim Hak Song, an ethnic Korean born in China, was detained in May 2017 for ""hostile acts."" He worked in agricultural development at an experimental farm run by the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, which was founded in 2010 with donations from Christian groups. Another American detainee, Otto Warmbier, died in June 2017 -- just days after he was brought back to the U.S. with severe brain damage. He had been arrested in January 2016 and accused of stealing a propaganda poster and was sentenced to 15 years in prison with hard labor. Pompeo<U+2019>s short trip is the latest move in a constantly evolving diplomatic situation in the region. Kim met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in China on Tuesday, the second meeting in recent months, and also met this month with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in South Korea. During the summit, the two discussed denuclearization and declared a formal end to the Korean War. The North Korean regime has also claimed it will end its nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missile testing program. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Worst royal wedding dress code mistakes BlackRock strategist on how you should invest","Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that three Americans held in North Korea have been released and are on their way back home. ""I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health,"" Trump tweeted.  He added that Pompeo had a ""good meeting"" with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and said a ""date & place set"" for a meeting between the two leaders. The President said Pompeo and his ""guests"" will be arriving at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland at 2 a.m. ET, presumably Thursday, where he will greet them. The Americans, Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak-song and Kim Sang Duk, also known as Tony Kim, have been held in North Korea for months. While Kim Dong Chul has been in North Korean custody since before Trump was elected, the other two detainees were arrested last spring, after Trump's inauguration and as tensions between Washington and Pyongyang were beginning to ramp up. Tony Kim and Kim Hak-song, who were arrested in April and May of 2017, respectively, were both accused of carrying out ""hostile acts"" against the Kim Jong Un regime. Both worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, which bills itself as the only privately run university in the North Korean capital. The family members of the two educators have said their loved ones are innocent. Shortly after Kim Hak-song was detained, his wife said in an interview with CNN that her husband is an agricultural expert and was teaching rice-growing at the university, trying to help North Koreans feed themselves. Kim Dong Chul was arrested in 2015 for spying on behalf of South Korea, he told CNN in January 2016. The interview was conducted in the presence of North Korean officials, so CNN could not determine whether Kim's comments were made under duress. An official with knowledge of the negotiations previously told CNN that the North Koreans decided to free the Americans two months ago, and that North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, had proposed their release during his visit to Sweden in March. At the time, US officials insisted that their release ""must not be related or used to loosen the main issue of denuclearization,"" the source said, but that message seems to have changed in recent days, according to a source at the National Security Council, who said the development would be viewed as a goodwill gesture ahead of the planned summit with Kim Jong Un. Trump and his allies outside the government had sought to fan the heightened expectations ahead of Thursday's official announcement, casting the potential development as evidence of his negotiating prowess ahead of the summit. Trump had hinted at a potential development in their case last week in a tweet: ""As everybody is aware, the past Administration has long been asking for three detainees to be released from a North Korean Labor camp, but to no avail. Stay tuned!"" He did not mention that two of the Americans had been detained after he became President. And Rudy Giuliani, a member of Trump's legal team but not himself an employee of the government, teased the release last week as well. "
