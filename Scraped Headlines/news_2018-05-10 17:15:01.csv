                                    Connecticut is joining other liberal states in a pact where states could allocate all its electoral votes to the candidate who wins the nationwide popular vote in presidential contests, regardless of the state<U+2019>s results

                                 Connecticut is joining a growing alliance of liberal states in a ""pact"" that would supposedly allow them to change the way presidents are picked -- by allocating each state's electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote.<U+00A0> The uphill campaign, which if ever brought to fruition would almost certainly face a court challenge, has gained renewed attention amid Democratic grumbling about the Electoral College in the wake of President Trump's 2016 win. While he defeated Hillary Clinton in the electoral vote, he lost the popular vote by 2.9 million ballots. Enter the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which blue states are joining to commit to allocating their electoral votes to the national popular-vote winner -- regardless of their own state results.<U+00A0> The pact is meant to be a work-around to the constitutional requirements that created the Electoral College system, which awards each state's electors to the winner of that state. In theory, the game-changing compact would take effect once it signs on states representing at least 270 electoral votes, the threshold to win the presidency. With the expected addition of Connecticut's seven electoral votes, the group now has 172. Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy is expected to sign the legislation into law, following the State Senate approving legislation opting Connecticut into the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact on May 5.

					         Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy is expected to sign the legislation into law, following the state Senate approving legislation opting Connecticut into the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact on May 5. The state House passed the legislation last month. <U+201C>The National Popular Vote Compact will ensure an equal vote for every American citizen, regardless of which state they happen to live in,<U+201D> Malloy said in a statement. Other jurisdictions that have joined the pact include California, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia <U+2014> all places where Clinton defeated Trump in 2016. Connecticut would be the first state to sign on since 2014, when New York joined. <U+201C>The vote of every American citizen should count equally, yet under the current system, voters from sparsely populated states are awarded significantly more power than those from states like Connecticut,<U+201D> Malloy said. <U+201C>This is fundamentally unfair.<U+201D> But critics say the pact would actually hurt smaller states like Connecticut, given that candidates would be likely to only focus on large population centers and neglect rural areas. And from a constitutional perspective, the proposal could also run into obvious legal challenges. <U+201C>Not only did the framers of the Constitution expressly reject the idea of a direct, popular election for president, but also not one state either in the wake of ratification or at any time thereafter has ever sought to appoint its presidential electors on the basis of votes cast outside the state, as the National Popular Vote Compact requires,<U+201D> law professor Norman R. Williams argued in the BYU Law Review. Trump has not publicly supported The National Popular Vote Compact. But he has said he would prefer picking a president based on the popular vote. <U+201C>I would rather have a popular election, but it's a totally different campaign,"" Trump said during an<U+00A0>interview last month ""Fox & Friends."" The plan has been pushed for last several years, and proponents are working to get other states to pass legislation joining the pact. According to the National Popular Vote website, the proposal has passed in at least one house in 11<U+00A0>other states, including Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, New Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma and Oregon.

In the most direct confrontation between Israel and Iran to date, the two regional enemies exchanged fire for hours during a volatile night. The extended barrage of fire comes amid soaring tensions between Israel and Iran, two rivals battling for regional influence, and less than two days after the United States withdrew from the deal to curb Iran's nuclear program. In a YouTube statement Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had ""crossed a red line,"" and that Israel's action was appropriate. ""Whoever hits us will get hit seven times over. Whoever prepares themselves to attack us will be attacked first. That is what we have done and that is what we will continue doing,"" Netanyahu said. Israel said more than 20 rockets were launched by Iranian forces in Syria in the direction of Israel late Wednesday, often criss-crossing in the clear night skies. A number of those rockets were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome aerial defense system, resulting in bright and sudden explosions. Israel retaliated with what appeared to be surface-to-surface missiles, and Syrian anti-aircraft batteries hosed the sky with fire in an effort to intercept them. Thunderclaps of Israeli artillery fire reverberated across the frontier between Syria and Israel, with the faint sound of impact echoing back moments later.  ""Israel has hit almost all of Iran's infrastructure in Syria,"" Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said Thursday morning. ""If it will rain in Israel, there will be a biblical flood on the other side.""  He reiterated Israel's stance that this latest offensive was not an ongoing operation, adding: ""I hope this chapter is over, and everyone understands the situation, and we won't have to spend nights in situation rooms."" Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said Israel had successfully hit dozens of Iranian targets in Syria in what he described as ""the largest operation against Iranian targets"" in years.  Iran's leaders have not yet issued a response to the Israeli accusations or the military strikes, but if confirmed it would be the first time Iranian forces have fired rockets directly at Israeli forces.  All night, drones buzzed overhead, heard but not seen in the darkness.  Three people were killed and two others were injured by the Israeli missiles, the Syrian military said in a statement. The strikes also destroyed a radar station, ammunition depot and caused material damage to Syria's air defense, it said.  The Syrian military claimed that its air defense managed to intercept and destroy a ""big part of the wave of Israeli missiles that targeted a number of our military positions.""  In a statement delivered shortly after midnight Thursday, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces pinned the blame for the rocket fire on the Quds Force, an elite division of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has forces in Syria and is often seen as the face of Iran's regional ambitions.  Conricus said the rockets, which were targeted at front-line Israeli military positions in the Golan Heights, were all either downed by aerial defense systems or fell short and landed in Syria.  On Wednesday night, state-run Sana TV, in southern Syria, carried reports that Israel had fired several missiles at the city of Baath in Quneitra, none of which resulted in casualties.  A short time later, Syrian state-run media reported that while dozens of ""hostile"" Israeli missiles had been intercepted in Syrian airspace, at least two others had hit an ammunition depot and destroyed a radar site.  The targets included rocket launchers, intelligence posts, military command posts, and weapons depots. No Israeli fighter jets were hit in the strikes, but Conricus said they came under heavy anti-aircraft fire. He added that ""ground assets were also used to strike into Syria."" The IDF released a map showing a list of targets it said it hit. Russia, which like Iran has intervened in Syria's war on the side of the government, called for ""restraint on all sides"" Thursday.  In a statement, the White House said: ""The United States condemns the Iranian regime's provocative rocket attacks from Syria against Israeli citizens, and we strongly support Israel's right to act in self-defense."" ""Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) bears full responsibility for the consequences of its reckless actions,"" the statement added.  High alert Israel had been expecting an Iranian response for some time, following a series of military strikes in Syria that targeted Iranian positions. Syria and Iran blamed those strikes on Israel, and Iran's leaders vowed revenge.  One of the strikes occurred Tuesday night, only hours after President Donald Trump had withdrawn the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, sparking fears of further destabilization in the Middle East. A US defense official told CNN that it was an Israeli military strike that hit suspected Iranian weapons near Damascus. Israel has not commented on the strike. On Tuesday, the IDF went on high alert in anticipation of an Iranian response, in addition to calling up a limited number of reserve troops ""on an as needed basis."" Israel opened bomb shelters in the Golan Heights, but did not instruct people to enter the shelters.  On Wednesday morning, the IDF chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, visited the Golan Heights to meet with military and civilian leaders on the IDF's assessment of the situation. Israel says it has a series of ""red lines"" in Syria; among them, preventing Iran's military entrenchment in the country. Netanyahu reiterated that in his statement Thursday, calling on the international community to prevent Iran's Quds Force from basing in Syria. ""We need to unite to dismember the arm of the evil that is spreading itself in every place,"" he said. Netanyahu also said Israel's most recent strike was a message to Assad's regime. He said Israel's ""operations are against Iranian targets in Syria, but if the Syrian army will act against us, we will act against them."" ""That is exactly what happened yesterday. [The] Syrian army fired ground-to-air missiles against, us so we hit them."" Putin had urged restraint On Wednesday, Netanyahu met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Victory Day, which marks the 1945 defeat of Nazi Germany.  In a bilateral meeting after the celebrations, Netanyahu said that Israel has the ""obligation and right to defend itself against Iranian aggression, from Syrian territory. They are trying to transfer forces and deadly weapons there with the explicit goal of attacking the State of Israel. Certainly, it is Israel's right to take such steps as necessary to defend itself against this aggression."" Putin, as one of the few leaders who has good relations and significant influence with both Israel and Iran, urged restraint.  ""The situation, unfortunately, is very acute. I want to hope that we will be able not only to discuss with you, but also to look for solutions that would soften the situation,"" said Putin. Russia and Israel coordinate their actions within Syria for the purpose of deconfliction. According to Conricus, Israel notified Russia before carrying out the overnight strikes.  Russian and Iranian intervention in Syria's long-running civil war helped tilt the balance of power back towards Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.  In an interview with the Greek newspaper Kathimerini published Thursday, Assad said fears of a third world war erupting in Syria were misplaced, despite escalating tensions.  Assad told the paper that ""wise Russian leadership"" would prevent such an event, describing the current conflict as ""something more than a cold war, less than a full-blown war."" He also took aim at the US, saying the Russians ""know that the agenda of the deep state in the United States is to create a conflict."" Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981 after capturing it from Syria in the Six Day Way in 1967. The international community has never recognized the annexation and regards the Golan Heights as Israeli-occupied territory. CNN's Oren Liebermann reported from Golan Heights.
