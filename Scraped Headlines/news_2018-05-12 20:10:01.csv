","Reports: Two people, including the attacker, have been killed in a stabbing attack in Paris.
 A suspect killed by French authorities after knifing five people and<U+00A0>ultimately killing one in central Paris has been claimed as a <U+201C>soldier<U+201D> of ISIS, the extremist group<U+2019>s news agency said. The Islamic State (ISIS) claimed responsibility for Saturday night<U+2019>s knife attack, saying it was in response to ISIS' calls for supporters to target members of the U.S.-led military coalition squeezing the extremists out of Iraq and Syria, the Aamaq news agency said in a statement. An unidentified suspect carried out a stabbing attack Saturday evening in the 2nd Arrondissement of Paris, north of the Seine River, which ultimately led to two casualties, including the attacker. Two other people were seriously injured and two more were slightly injured. A police officer cordons off the area after a knife attack in central Paris, Saturday May 12, 2018.

					         Counterterrorism authorities were called in to lead the investigation after Prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters that witnesses heard the suspect shouting, ""Allahu Akbar"" -- ""God is great"" in Arabic. Paris police said the attacker was subdued by officers and later confirmed that the ""assailant passed away."" Witnesses reportedly said that the police first tried to use a stun gun on the<U+00A0>attacker, but when that failed, they fired two shots,<U+00A0>the BBC reported, citing France24. Police did not confirm local media reports that the suspect had been fatally shot. The Paris police said the attacker was subdued by officers during the stabbing attack in the 2nd arrondissement or district of the French capital Saturday.

					         The attack took place in a popular neighborhood near Paris<U+2019> famed Opera Garnier. People were asked to evacuate nearby buildings. Police said that the suspect targeted the five people. In a tweet sharing his condolences, French President Emmanuel Macron labeled the attacker a <U+201C>terrorist.<U+201D> <U+201C>All my thoughts go to the victims and the wounded of the knife attack perpetrated tonight in Paris, as well as to their relatives. I salute on behalf of all the French the courage of the policemen who have neutralized the terrorist,<U+201D> his tweet was translated to. <U+201C>France once again paid the price of blood but did not give an inch to the enemies of Freedom,<U+201D> Macron said in another, defiant tweet. France's BFM television interviewed an unnamed witness in a restaurant who said a young woman was at the entrance when ""a man arrived and attacked her with a knife."" A friend came to her aid and the attacker left, ""hitting on all the doors, all the shops,"" the witness told BFM. He turned onto another street, and everyone scattered, the witness said. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb denounced the attack in a tweet, which translated as, ""My first thoughts are with the victims of this odious act."" Paris has been under elevated security in recent years after a string of deadly Islamic extremist attacks. The Associated Press contributed to this report."

John McCain, according to several sources familiar with the meeting.  In discussing McCain's opposition to CIA nominee Gina Haspel, Sadler, a special assistant who handles surrogate communications for the White House, said in a private meeting Thursday that it doesn't matter ""because he's dying anyway."" It was a joke that fell flat, a White House official told CNN. Despite publicly refusing to criticize the remark, Sanders told the press staff that Sadler's comment was inappropriate, according to several sources familiar with the meeting. During the dressing down, Sanders focused more on how the remark was leaked apparently in an attempt to target Sadler with a damaging story, one of the sources told CNN. White House strategic communications director Mercedes Schlapp spoke up during the session to defend Sadler, one of the sources said.   Both publicly and privately, according to the sources, Sanders has focused more on the leaking of the comment than its substance. In Friday's White House press briefing, Sanders repeatedly said she would not ""validate a leak"" or comment on an internal staff meeting. Asked directly why not simply apologize to McCain, who was diagnosed with brain cancer, and his family, she said: ""I'm not going to get into a back and forth because people want to create issues of leaked staff meetings."" Sadler is still employed at the White House, Sanders said Friday.  Responding Saturday to the controversial comments, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called Sadler's remarks a ""disgusting thing to say"" and said he was dissatisfied with the administration's response to the controversy.  ""If it was a joke, it was a terrible joke,"" Graham, who is close friends with McCain and visited him in Arizona this week, told ""Face the Nation"" moderator Margaret Brennan in an excerpt of an interview set to air Sunday. ""I just wish somebody from the White House would tell the country that was inappropriate, that's not who we are in the Trump administration."" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney pushed back Saturday on calls to fire the aide, saying the purported joke about McCain's health was ""awful"" but not worth firing her over.  ""You have to have freedom to speak in a private meeting, to speak candidly,"" Mulvaney said Saturday on Fox News. ""We've all said things in private, especially in smaller groups that we work with, that we would never say publicly."" Echoing Sanders' private comments to staffers, Mulvaney said the leak was designed to hurt Sadler and ""completely ignored the harm it would do to the McCain family, which is doubly inconsiderate."" ""I'm really disappointed that someone would undermine the President by leaking that out of a private meeting,"" he said, adding that he, as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, was not present at the meeting in which Sadler made the remark. After her comment was reported Thursday, Sadler called Meghan McCain, the senator's daughter, to apologize for the remark, a source close to the situation told CNN. Mulvaney told Fox News that in doing so, Sadler handled the situation ""appropriately."" However, on ""The View"" Friday, McCain questioned how Sadler still had her job.  CNN's Abby Phillip contributed to this report."
