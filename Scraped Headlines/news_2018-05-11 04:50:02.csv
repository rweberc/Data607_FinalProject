                                        <U+00A0>(Apau Hawaii Tours/Social Media via Reuters)
                                    
                                 HILO, Hawaii <U+2013> <U+00A0>Residents near one of the world<U+2019>s most active volcanos were warned Thursday of rising levels of toxic gas, as concerns on the ground grew that Kilauea could blow at any minute. A wind change could bring even more sulfur dioxide gas to the southeast section of the Big Island. <U+201C>Due to decreasing tradewinds, residents are advised to monitor their sensitivity to increased levels of (sulfur dioxide),<U+201D> a text alert message sent Thursday said. If inhaled in large quantities, the wafting gas can be fatal. The new warning comes as Hawaii Gov. David Ige says mass evacuations may occur as more cracks, or fissures, are detected. Kilauea has destroyed 36 structures <U+2014> including 26 homes <U+2014> since May 3, when it began releasing lava from vents about 25 miles east of the summit crater. Fifteen of the vents are now spread through the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens neighborhoods. About 2,000 people have been evacuated from the neighborhoods, where scorching lava has oozed from the ground. The volcano, which has been spitting and sputtering lava for a week, has also imperiled a geothermal energy plant, the<U+00A0> Puna Geothermal Venture plant. Ige said crews at the plant near the lava outbreak accelerated the removal of stored flammable fuel with safety in mind. Barbara Lozano, who lives within a mile of the plant, said she would have thought twice about buying her property if she had known the risks. ""Why did they let us buy residential property, knowing it was a dangerous situation? Why did they let people build all around it?<U+201D> <U+201C>Why did they let us buy residential property, knowing it was a dangerous situation? Why did they let people build all around it?<U+201D> she asked worriedly. Coffee farmer Palikapu Dedman, 71, has dedicated half his life to battling the plant that sits on the long slopes of Kilauea. He and other native Hawaiians say the plant desecrates traditional beliefs and angers Pele, the goddess of fire, who lives at the summit crater. Now that the plant is threatened by Kilauea, Dedman says he feels vindicated. ""You really can<U+2019>t hurt Pele,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s just reinforcement of my beliefs <U+2014> she<U+2019>s present! And the plant could get covered by lava tomorrow.<U+201D> The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) warned that the growing instability in the area could mean other areas of the island also could be at risk. Ige told CNN that it<U+2019>s been tough for residents. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s a sense that it<U+2019>s Mother Nature,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>The lava flow is unpredictable. It<U+2019>s hard to determine which direction it will go. It starts and stops on a whim. That<U+2019>s the uncertainty that residents are faced with.<U+201D> Geologists warned Wednesday that Kilauea could soon experience explosive eruptions from its summit, and launch <U+201C>ballistic<U+201D> rocks and ash into the air. The next explosion could hurl ash and boulders the size of refrigerators miles into the air, shutting down airline traffic and endangering lives in all directions. <U+201C>If it goes up, it will come down,<U+201D> said Charles Mandeville, volcano hazards coordinator for the U.S. Geological Survey. <U+201C>You don<U+2019>t want to be underneath anything that weighs 10 tons when it<U+2019>s coming out at 120 mph.<U+201D> The added threat of an explosive eruption could ground planes at one of the Big Island<U+2019>s two major airports and pose other dangers. The national park around the volcano announced that it would close because of the risks. <U+201C>We know the volcano is capable of doing this,<U+201D> said Mandeville, citing similar explosions at Kilauea in 1925, 1790 and four other times in the last few thousand years. <U+201C>We know it is a distinct possibility.<U+201D> The threat of explosive activity will rise as lava drains from the summit of Kilauea and explosions will be possible in the coming weeks if the lava dips below the groundwater table, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. If lava drops below the groundwater level, it can heat up the water and create steam. The steam would then build in pressure as rocks fall and form a dam within the volcano<U+2019>s walls, and <U+201D>cause steam-driven explosions<U+201D> with <U+201C>very little warning,<U+201D> according to the HVO. The volcano then could eject <U+201C>ballistic rocks<U+201D> of lava up to several feet in diameter, the USGS said. It also may send pebbles shooting into the air several miles away. A similar 1924 explosion threw pulverized rock, ash and steam as high as 5.4 miles into the sky, for a couple of weeks. If another blast happens, the danger zone could extend about three miles around the summit, land all inside the national park, Mandeville said. Fox News<U+2019> Frank Miles and Stephen Sorace, and The Associated Press, contributed to this report. <U+00A0> <U+00A0> <U+00A0> <U+00A0> <U+00A0>"

Now she's a billionaire Before she became a CEO, she was fired and laid off"," (CNN)Israel says that it's done with strikes on Iran -- for now. France fears an escalation. Iran has its finger on the trigger. But, really, it's Russian President Vladimir Putin who sits in the hot seat. Where once the US would have been the brake on spikes in Syrian violence, there is a real possibility President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal is greasing the wheels towards a wider regional war. In recent months, the world's top diplomat, UN Secretary-General Ant<U+00F3>nio Guterres, has warned that Israeli and Iranian tit-for-tat strikes in Syria could quickly boil over to a regional conflagration. Overnight Wednesday, rockets fired by Iranian forces from inside Syria toward Israel triggered a forewarned robust response from Israel's military -- targeting Iranian military assets in Syria. Since early February, when Israel says it shot down an Iranian drone laden with explosives that was launched from Syria, the Israeli Defense Forces have increased retaliatory strikes in Syria at Iranian targets. Some of those strikes are reported to have killed several Iranian fighters. Yet until this point there had been no Iranian retaliation. The sudden surge in the exchange of rockets Wednesday night -- on the heels of Trump's exit from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- hints that Iran has suspended its strategic restraint. If so, the likelihood that the Iranian-Israeli confrontation will escalate increases. In Tehran, President Hassan Rouhani warned Germany, France and the UK, that they have only ""a very limited time to save the JCPOA."" But he is a moderate. The Iranians fighting in Syria fall under a more hardline command. It's their comrades who have been killed in Israeli strikes and their patience will have worn thinner than Rouhani's strategic politicking. Most European diplomats fear that once the Trump's administration leans on European businesses hard enough, they won't be able to plug the economic shortfall, something Rouhani needs so he can sell the Iran deal without America at home. In short, the gloves in a potential Israel-Iran confrontation are coming off. The question is this: were Wednesday night's strikes the opening salvo, or a sign of what is to come? President Emmanuel Macron of France fears the former. His staff in Paris say he is pushing for calm: ""He calls for de-escalation and he will talk about this with the German Chancellor today."" Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said on Thursday morning that most of Iran's infrastructure in Syria was hit and that he hopes this chapter of ""Iranian radicalism"" is over. But indicating that what happens next is down to Iran, he added: ""If it will rain in Israel, there will be a biblical flood on the other side."" In Damascus, a Greek reporter asked President Bashar al-Assad if Syria would be the venue for world war three. His response: ""No, for one reason: because fortunately, you have a wise leadership in Russia."" Putin -- as many international diplomats have warned could happen -- finds himself, absent a working peace plan in Syria, riding a tiger. A bigger war in Syria would require a bigger military spend from him -- something that would further strain his own stretched economy. Recently reelected, he has plenty of political capital but not a lot of real cash to spare. US and European sanctions have been eating a hole in Russia's pocket. The ruble has had a rocky ride in recent months. During his Wednesday visit to the Kremlin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is understood to have warned Putin about strikes on Iran's military assets inside Syria. As Iran is Russia's principal ally keeping Assad in power, Moscow is very carefully tracking Israel's every move. For whatever reason, Putin appeared willing to see Iran hit, knowing the straining and destabilizing effect it may have on their alliance backing Assad. That Netanyahu, Trump's most ardent supporter in dumping the JCPOA, was in Moscow the day before the attack signals many things -- not least the dangerous complexity of having so many powers at play in such a confined conflict. But it also emphasizes the  diminishing US influence in Syria -- and the region in general. In Riyadh on Wednesday, Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir reiterated his country's warnings about Iran's nuclear ambitions, saying: ""We have made it very clear that if Iran acquires nuclear capability we will do everything we can to do the same."" After Israel, the Saudis are the biggest backer of Trump's decision to pull out of the JCPOA. They fears growing Iranian influence in the region -- not just to their north in Syria and Iraq, but over their southern border in Yemen. On Wednesday, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who tossed Yemen's internationally recognized government from power four years ago, fired long-range ballistic missiles into Saudi. One was reportedly shot down by a US-made Saudi counter-missile battery just outside the capital Riyadh. In recent months, Houthis have stepped up missile attacks targeting Riyadh. None have gotten through so far. But patience in Riyadh is running thin -- the expectation there is that Trump's exit from the JCPOA could signal a ramped-up Saudi targeting of Houthi leaders. How Iran would handle its Houthi proxies in this case is unclear. But international concern has been growing, particularly over the past week, as the Saudi-led coalition's airstrikes in Yemen have allegedly hit several civilian targets recently. In pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, Trump hinted at the peace benefit for the region: ""If I allowed this deal to stand, there would soon be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.  Everyone would want their weapons ready by the time Iran had theirs."" While no one expected those lofty long-term goals realized already, just two days later, most diplomats hoped the lid could be kept on tensions until everyone outside the White House could figure out the next step forward. There was no ""plan B."" It's being made up on the fly, with no guarantees hardliners don't derail the world's diplomats. Escape routes are still open, but the fog and consequences of sudden conflict may soon shut them down. Today, it's still possible -- albeit highly improbable -- that should Trump decide, he could give European businesses ""cutouts"" and allow them to continue working in Iran; then maybe Iran's moderates can buy more time and rein in their hardliners before it's too late. But the reality is, exiting the JCPOA has ushered in a new era of international relations where the unexpected and unpredictable have a far greater possibility of rapidly outpacing common sense and routine diplomacy.
