Tuesday's GOP primary results showed both Republicans and Democrats moving toward the center as voters look ahead to this fall's midterm elections. Republicans are looking to increase the party's Senate majority and maintain control of the House, while Democrats snubbed progressive candidates in favor of moderates -- including one who backed Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016. Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia's attorney general, came out the winner of the state's contentious GOP Senate primary, defeating controversial former coal executive Don Blankenship. In Indiana's GOP Senate primary, businessman Mike Braun, who mostly self-funded his campaign, won against U.S. Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita.  –– ADVERTISEMENT –– Jim Renacci won the GOP Senate primary in Ohio. The Ohio results were attributed to the influence of President Trump, who endorsed Renacci over businessman Mike Gibbons. Trump also made a last-minute appeal to West Virginia voters to reject Blankenship in a bid to avoid the repeat of December's Senate race in Alabama, where Democrat Doug Jones turned the deep-red state blue -- for the first time in decades. ""To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey"" Trump tweeted Monday. But Tuesday's results also seemed to vindicate Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the subject of multiple personal attacks during the primaries. Blankenship branded McConnell ""Cocaine Mitch"" and referring to his Asian-American in-laws as ""his China family."" The McConnell team could not hide its glee after the results. They taunted Blankenship with a photo of a smiling McConnell, with the caption reading, ""Thanks for playing, Don."" McConnell has long sought to put the Republican house in order before the midterms, admitting that the party faces some tough fights in November.  ""This is going to be a challenging election year,” McConnell told Kentucky Today in April. “We know the wind is going to be in our face. We don’t know whether it’s going to be a Category 3, 4 or 5.” But as Republicans show signs of getting serious and choosing candidates that can appeal beyond the Trump voters, Democrats on Tuesday -- much to the chagrin of the progressive base -- favored blue-collar, middle-of-the-road candidates. In West Virginia's 3rd District, state Sen. Richard Ojeda clinched the victory in the Democratic primary. The win was a defeat for progressive supporters of the party, as Ojeda famously said he backed Trump over Clinton in 2016, the Washington Post reported. Democrat Richard Cordray, meanwhile, was declared the party's nominee for Ohio governor after he defeated former congressman and ex-Cleveland Mayor Dennis Kucinich. Kucinich had criticized Cordray as a ""Republican-lite"" candidate who was too moderate on key issues concerning most Democrats, and was once backed by the National Rifle Association (NRA). Kucinich ran on a platform of single-payer health care, gun control and criminal justice reform. But Cordray, who once ran the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under President Barack Obama, fought back and pointed out that Kucinich accepted $20,000 from a group with links to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. “Kucinich bothered me because of the whole Assad thing,” voter Robert Halpin, 57, told the Post. “I didn’t like Cordray because of the NRA. But in the end, weighing it, I don’t like Assad more [than I don’t like the NRA], so I went with Cordray.” In Indiana's 2nd District, former Republican and health care executive Mel Hall cruised to victory against candidates advocating for universal health care. Moderate Democrats also won Tuesday in two North Carolina districts, defeating far-left challengers.

It also opened a new window into Trump's political soul, showing his willingness to unleash the kind of chaos abroad he has fomented at home. The decision added context to his ""America First"" foreign policy doctrine and showed he is adamant about following through on campaign promises that horrified America's allies. And it revealed two other pillars of the Trump presidency -- a propensity to turn even the most crucial moments into a global televised drama, and his ravenous desire to eradicate President Barack Obama from the history books. Trump is the 'no Plan B' president The most frequently heard criticism of Trump's decision was that he was pulling out of the deal without offering a plan for what will happen next. ""No one has any clue on the day after. There is no strategy,"" a senior European diplomat told CNN's Michelle Kosinski, describing the State Department as ""a shambles."" But if anyone is shocked, they have missed Trump rolling the dice over the last 16 months. The President fires people before he finds replacements, makes up policy on the fly, decided to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un seemingly on a whim, and slashed away at Obamacare without offering a replacement. His legal gambits seem to come off the top of his head -- with or without Rudy Giuliani. He follows his gut, doesn't sweat the details and thinks he's his own best adviser. He breaks things and sees where the pieces land. His response when asked how dangerous global crises will end is ""we'll see"" -- an attitude that reflects his unpredictable nature and often misplaced confidence he can control careening events. So what Trump did Tuesday should have come as no surprise. Pulling out of an Iranian nuclear deal without knowing how Tehran or America's allies will react or if global tensions will spike or if oil prices will surge is consistent with who Trump is. His team could not say what they would do if Iran resumed enriching uranium or if there was a schism in the transatlantic relationship. ""We did not talk about a Plan B,"" a senior State Department official said. If 'America First' means America alone -- so be it   In Davos in January, Trump said that ""America First does not mean America alone."" That is no longer a credible statement. Trump surely lost no sleep by unilaterally violating an international nuclear agreement endorsed by the UN Security Council -- the chance to go it alone was likely a selling point. To purge his antipathy to the deal, Trump split with America's European allies, France, Britain and Germany, leaders of which had all but begged him to stay in. It was a sign that traditional alliances are less important to Trump than to any President of the post-World War II era, and shows that loyalty to friends, as in his personal and political life, cuts only one way. After all, only two weeks ago he was kissing and holding hands with Emmanuel Macron during the French President's charm offensive. Trump's administration is already trying to bully allies: new ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell tweeted Tuesday: ""As @realDonaldTrump said, US sanctions will target critical sectors of Iran's economy. German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately."" It was not the first time that Trump rejected multi-lateral solutions to the world's problems. He pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and the Paris climate accord. He's torn at the system of international trade with disputes with China, Canada, Mexico and South Korea. Trump clearly doesn't care what foreign elites and national security experts think -- his decision to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is evidence of that. That was his appeal to his voters and he's sticking with it. Tuesday's move also shows that he's throwing in his lot with Middle East allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Israel, who want to crank up military and diplomatic pressure on Iran. But he's also rejecting what much of Washington sees as America's global role. ""We are giving up our global leadership ... and I'm concerned, as are many of my colleagues,"" GOP Sen. Jeff Flake told CNN's Jake Tapper But to Trump, leadership means he leads and the rest of the world follows. Whether that is a credible basis for American diplomacy will be one of the most important questions answered by the rest of his presidency. Trump keeps his promises The President vowed to ditch the Paris deal and the TPP -- he did. He was against the Iran agreement even before he was a candidate and ended US participation. Tuesday's decision was a reminder that nothing is as important to Trump as keeping faith with his supporters even if it means sparking global disruption. It's not just a matter of honesty, it's about political survival since he has made little effort to reach beyond his base and needs huge turnouts to stave off the threat of a Democratic takeover of the House in November and to keep his job in 2020. Of course, there are plenty of promises that Trump didn't keep. He vowed to build a health care system for everyone better than Obamacare, but has done little but undermine his predecessor's namesake law. His tax cut does far more for the wealthiest Americans than the blue collar voters he vowed to help. Still, Trump will use his withdrawal from the Iran deal to convince his voters that he will never shatter the bond they share. Facts don't seem to matter The Iran announcement was quintessentially Trumpian. He misrepresented the restrictions imposed by the Iran nuclear deal and suggested, against the testimony of his own intelligence agencies, that the Islamic Republic was already violating it. For instance, he said that Iran was continuing to enrich uranium that would allow it eventually to build a bomb. But under the deal, Tehran can enrich limited quantities of uranium up to 3.67% -- well below the 90% weapons grade uranium needed to build a bomb. He also used Israeli intelligence about Iran's historic pursuit of the knowledge to make nuclear weapons to suggest to Americans not familiar with the deal that Tehran was not in compliance. Trump also created his own alternative reality to suggest he would bring Tehran rushing back to the table begging for a deal that would be better for America. ""The fact is they are going to want to make a new and lasting deal. One that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people,"" Trump said. Given that America's European allies, and Russia and China plan to stick with the existing deal, leverage -- made of punitive multilateral sanctions -- that got Iran to the table during the Obama administration could be elusive for Trump. Trump really hates Obama   It has been a reliable guide to the President's actions -- if Obama was for it he is against it. Foreign diplomats said privately that one reason Trump hates the Iran deal was that it was the proudest foreign policy achievement of the Democratic president. Obama Tuesday issued one of his most detailed statements since he left office. ""I hope that Americans continue to speak out in support the kind of strong, principled, fact-based and unifying leadership that can best secure our country and uphold our responsibilities around the globe,"" he wrote. It was a clear shot at Trump's method and character as he joined a battle between the legacies of the 44th and 45th presidents that will echo long after they are both gone. Trump the showman Trump loves to be the star of the show. He has welcomed pleading foreign leaders to his court and drip, drip, dripped tantalizing details about his decision on Iran for weeks. He gathered himself behind the presidential podium on Tuesday, squaring his jaw and staring into the camera with the world on tenterhooks, relishing his leading role. And as he wrapped up one long-running drama, he set the stage for his next, even more spectacular moment. He revealed he had dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to North Korea to choreograph the next episode of the Trump show -- his mind-boggling summit with Kim.
