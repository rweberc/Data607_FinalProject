President Trump<U+2019>s nominee for CIA director Gina Haspel on Wednesday defended her <U+201C>moral compass<U+201D> as she brushed back Democratic criticism of her handling of the post-9/11 detention and interrogation program --<U+00A0>while sharing gripping details about her credentials as a lifelong spy.<U+00A0> Haspel spoke at her confirmation hearing to replace now-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the agency's helm, and sought to head off criticism about her role in the interrogation of terror suspects. While GOP lawmakers and bipartisan voices from the intelligence community have strongly backed her bid, Democrats have threatened to stall her nomination over the Bush-era programs.<U+00A0> But under repeated questioning from Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee who were critical of that phase in her career, Haspel did not hesitate to remind them of the important role played by the intelligence community after the 9/11 attacks. <U+201C>After 9/11 <U+2026> I stepped up. I was not on the sidelines, I was on the frontlines in the Cold War and I was on the frontlines in the fight against Al Qaeda,<U+201D> she said in response to grilling from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a possible 2020 presidential candidate, also repeatedly pressed her to give a yes or no answer as to whether the prior interrogation program was immoral, and scolded her when she wouldn't: ""You also, in this hearing, have a responsibility to answer the questions being asked of you.""<U+00A0> But Haspel pledged early on the hearing that under her leadership, post-9/11-era interrogation would not be resumed. <U+201C>I have views on this issue, and I want to be clear. Having served in that tumultuous time, I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership on my watch CIA will not restart such a detention and interrogation program,<U+201D> she said. Haspel, currently the deputy CIA director, was chief of a base at a black-site prison in Thailand in 2002, where controversial interrogation techniques were used on detainees -- including waterboarding. Senate Democrats have questioned her fitness to run the agency due to their objections to interrogation techniques. They have also complained that the CIA has failed to declassify enough information about her career, leaving the public in the dark about what sort of CIA director she may be. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has also said he will not vote for her confirmation. At the hearing, Haspel said she was confident she would not allow the CIA to engage in illegal or immoral activity, even if it came from a presidential order.<U+00A0> <U+201C>My moral compass is strong, I would not allow CIA to undertake activity that I thought was immoral even if it was technically legal -- I would absolutely not permit it.<U+201D> But some Democrats challenged her answers, particularly what Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., described as <U+201C>legalistic<U+201D> responses -- but Haspel refused to criticize actions by colleagues. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m not going to sit here with the benefit of hindsight and judge the very good people who made hard decisions who were running the agency in very extraordinary circumstances at the time,<U+201D> she said. It did little to stop the criticism, however. <U+201C>Where was that moral compass at the time?<U+201D> Heinrich asked.<U+00A0> Haspel was also grilled about her role in the 2005 destruction of over 92 interrogation tapes. She testified that they were destroyed on the order of her supervisor at the time Jose Rodriguez and that she was not on the tapes, though she told senators she was an advocate for destroying the tapes to protect the identity of CIA agents. In her opening remarks, the Kentucky-born Haspel described herself as a ""typical middle-class American -- one with a strong sense of right and wrong and one who loves this country."" ""I know CIA like the back of my hand. I know them, I know the threats we face, and I know what we need to be successful in our mission,"" she said. If confirmed, Haspel would be the first woman to lead the agency and said she had seen an ""outpouring of support from young women at CIA who consider it a good sign for their own prospects.""<U+00A0> She also offered dramatic and rare insight into her career as a spy, including her recollections of 9/11 as well as shadowy meetings with foreign contacts. ""I recall my first foreign agent meeting was on a dark, moonless night with an agent I<U+2019>d never met before,"" she said. ""When I picked him up, he passed me the intelligence and I passed him extra money for the men he led. It was the beginning of an adventure I had only dreamed of."" She also said she excelled in ""finding and acquiring secret information that I obtained in brush passes, dead drops, or in meetings in dusty back allies of third world capitals."" Despite Democratic objections, Haspel has won strong support from the intelligence community and bipartisan former officials including from the Obama administration. At the beginning of the hearing, Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., called her <U+201C>a natural fit<U+201D> for the role, and warned her opponents on the panel of turning the hearing into a ""trial about a long-shuttered program."" <U+201C>Those who have issued with programs or operations conducted years ago should address those concerns and questions to former presidents, former directors and former attorneys general,<U+201D> he said. During the hearing, a number of protesters interrupted Haspel's testimony and were removed from the committee room, yelling <U+201C>no more torture<U+201D> and <U+201C>say no to Gina.<U+201D> A number of <U+201C>Code Pink<U+201D> protesters remained in attendance throughout. Some outlets have accused Haspel of taking part in the waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah, an alleged Al Qaeda terrorist. News site ProPublica, originator of the allegations, has since retracted the article, saying Haspel arrived to the base after the interrogation of Zubaydah ended. But Leon Panetta, former CIA director and secretary of defense, said in a quote issued by the White House: <U+201C>I<U+2019>m glad it<U+2019>s Gina because frankly she is someone who really knows the CIA inside out.<U+201D> She has also found significant support from Republicans, some of whom have made full-throated endorsements of her nomination. <U+201C>Haspel<U+2019>s opponents have tried to use a small sliver of her career against her by arguing, essentially, that she was just too tough on Al Qaeda for this country to bear,<U+201D> Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said in an op-ed for FoxNews.com. <U+201C>But I<U+2019>d argue that her willingness to serve in what was a highly stressful post only enhances the case for her confirmation.<U+201D> Fox News is told that the full committee likely won<U+2019>t vote on her confirmation until next week. Haspel was reportedly preparing for the tough hearing by practicing her answers at mock confirmation hearings with former intelligence officials.<U+00A0> With the absence of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and the lack of support from Paul, it means that there is a maximum of 49 GOP votes for Haspel -- meaning that for her to be confirmed, some moderate Democrats would need to back her. A senior Senate Democratic source indicated that Haspel would win support of several Democrats, and that it was unclear if the Democratic leadership would whip against Haspel. Haspel's is the latest in a series of tough Trump-era confirmation fights. Pompeo was confirmed only after a contentious vote, while nominee for VA secretary, Dr. Ronnie Jackson, withdrew from consideration after allegations over his conduct as White House doctor. <U+200B><U+200B><U+200B>Fox News<U+2019> Jason Donner, Chad Pergram, Lukas Mikelionis and The Associated Press contributed to this report. <U+00A0> Adam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

Nothing new there.  But, this tweet was different: Trump unintentionally revealed the false premise on which his relentless calls of ""fake news"" is based. Here's the tweet: ""The Fake News is working overtime. Just reported that, despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy & all things else, 91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake). Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials?"" Put aside the authoritarian -- but ultimately empty -- threat about taking away the media's ""credentials,"" and focus instead on this sentence: ""91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake)."" Trump, I think, is referring to a 2017 study by the conservative Media Research Center which claimed that 91% of the nightly news coverage on the president was negative. But, that's not (really) the point here. The point can be summed up in these two words from Trump: ""negative (Fake)."" To Trump, those words mean the same thing. Negative news coverage is fake news. Fake news is negative news coverage. This is, of course, not true. Negative news coverage -- or, seen more accurately through the Trump lens, media coverage that he feels is not sufficiently favorable to him -- is not, by definition, fake. Fake news is made-up news. It's not based in traditional reporting values like facts and sourcing. It's not ""news"" at all. (Sidebar: The media -- me included -- does make mistakes. We're human. When it happens, we publicly correct the record. Trump seizes on those mistakes as incontrovertible evidence that the media is hopelessly fake. That would be like saying a person who got into one accident in 25 years of driving was a terrible and dangerous driver -- a drastic overstatement designed to score points with people already primed to believe the exaggeration.) Trump either doesn't understand or ignores the difference between a story he doesn't like and one that is not true. He conflates the two for his own political purposes -- knowing his base hates the media and is more than ready to believe that journalists are willing to make up stories just to make Trump look bad. Time and time again, Trump's claims about ""fake news"" have been debunked. What he calls fake news isn't fake at all. It's true -- he just doesn't like to read about it because it paints him as fallible, and he hates that.  Here's how Factcheck.org, a nonpartisan fact-checking operation at the Annenberg Public Policy Center, described Trump's approach to ""fake news"" in a detailed debunking of the idea headlined ""Trump's Phony 'Fake News' Claims"": President Donald Trump often dismisses news stories or media outlets that he doesn't like as ""fake news."" How often? A database of his public remarks contains 320 references last year to ""fake news."" Usually, it's a general complaint about news coverage <U+2014> such as his Christmas Eve tweet: ""The Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is."" But there are times, too, when he has labeled accurate news reporting as ""fake news"" or spread false information himself, while at the same time accusing the media of being ""fake"" or ""dishonest."" Here's the problem: Trump's attacks on the media -- as flawed and dishonest as they are -- are working. More than 4 in 10 people in a Gallup poll earlier this year could not name a single objective news source. Almost eight in 10 (77%) in a Monmouth University poll released last month said TV and print media report ""fake news."" That's a 14-point bump from the number of people who said the same last year. The media is not blameless in all of this. As I noted above, we do make mistakes. We have made major strides in transparency but need to do even more to show our work to people. The more open we are about how we do our jobs, the better chance we have of convincing people that our most basic commitment is to getting stories right, not pushing some sort of imagined ideological agenda. But, it's also important for people to understand what's behind Trump's aggressive anti-media campaign. Trump is about Trump. He calls media ""fake news"" because the coverage of him isn't as positive as he would like.  Try this experiment going forward. Every time Trump says or tweets the words ""fake news,"" sub in the words ""bad for me."" It's revealing. Enlightening. And true. "
