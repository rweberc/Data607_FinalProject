                                    A man in a gas mask takes pictures of a lava fissure at Leilani Estates, Hawaii, this week.
                                    
                                        <U+00A0>(Apau Hawaii Tours/Social Media via Reuters)
                                    
                                 HILO, Hawaii <U+2013> <U+00A0>Residents near one of the world<U+2019>s most active volcanos were warned Thursday of rising levels of toxic gas, as concerns on the ground grew that Kilauea could blow at any minute. A wind change could bring even more sulfur dioxide gas to the southeast section of the Big Island. <U+201C>Due to decreasing tradewinds, residents are advised to monitor their sensitivity to increased levels of (sulfur dioxide),<U+201D> a text alert message sent Thursday said. If inhaled in large quantities, the wafting gas can be fatal. The new warning comes as Hawaii Gov. David Ige says mass evacuations may occur as more cracks, or fissures, are detected. Kilauea has destroyed 36 structures <U+2014> including 26 homes <U+2014> since May 3, when it began releasing lava from vents about 25 miles east of the summit crater. Fifteen of the vents are now spread through the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens neighborhoods. About 2,000 people have been evacuated from the neighborhoods, where scorching lava has oozed from the ground. The volcano, which has been spitting and sputtering lava for a week, has also imperiled a geothermal energy plant, the<U+00A0> Puna Geothermal Venture plant. Ige said crews at the plant near the lava outbreak accelerated the removal of stored flammable fuel with safety in mind. Barbara Lozano, who lives within a mile of the plant, said she would have thought twice about buying her property if she had known the risks. ""Why did they let us buy residential property, knowing it was a dangerous situation? Why did they let people build all around it?<U+201D> <U+201C>Why did they let us buy residential property, knowing it was a dangerous situation? Why did they let people build all around it?<U+201D> she asked worriedly. Coffee farmer Palikapu Dedman, 71, has dedicated half his life to battling the plant that sits on the long slopes of Kilauea. He and other native Hawaiians say the plant desecrates traditional beliefs and angers Pele, the goddess of fire, who lives at the summit crater. Now that the plant is threatened by Kilauea, Dedman says he feels vindicated. ""You really can<U+2019>t hurt Pele,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s just reinforcement of my beliefs <U+2014> she<U+2019>s present! And the plant could get covered by lava tomorrow.<U+201D> The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) warned that the growing instability in the area could mean other areas of the island also could be at risk. Ige told CNN that it<U+2019>s been tough for residents. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s a sense that it<U+2019>s Mother Nature,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>The lava flow is unpredictable. It<U+2019>s hard to determine which direction it will go. It starts and stops on a whim. That<U+2019>s the uncertainty that residents are faced with.<U+201D> Geologists warned Wednesday that Kilauea could soon experience explosive eruptions from its summit, and launch <U+201C>ballistic<U+201D> rocks and ash into the air. The next explosion could hurl ash and boulders the size of refrigerators miles into the air, shutting down airline traffic and endangering lives in all directions. <U+201C>If it goes up, it will come down,<U+201D> said Charles Mandeville, volcano hazards coordinator for the U.S. Geological Survey. <U+201C>You don<U+2019>t want to be underneath anything that weighs 10 tons when it<U+2019>s coming out at 120 mph.<U+201D> The added threat of an explosive eruption could ground planes at one of the Big Island<U+2019>s two major airports and pose other dangers. The national park around the volcano announced that it would close because of the risks. <U+201C>We know the volcano is capable of doing this,<U+201D> said Mandeville, citing similar explosions at Kilauea in 1925, 1790 and four other times in the last few thousand years. <U+201C>We know it is a distinct possibility.<U+201D> The threat of explosive activity will rise as lava drains from the summit of Kilauea and explosions will be possible in the coming weeks if the lava dips below the groundwater table, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. If lava drops below the groundwater level, it can heat up the water and create steam. The steam would then build in pressure as rocks fall and form a dam within the volcano<U+2019>s walls, and <U+201D>cause steam-driven explosions<U+201D> with <U+201C>very little warning,<U+201D> according to the HVO. The volcano then could eject <U+201C>ballistic rocks<U+201D> of lava up to several feet in diameter, the USGS said. It also may send pebbles shooting into the air several miles away. A similar 1924 explosion threw pulverized rock, ash and steam as high as 5.4 miles into the sky, for a couple of weeks. If another blast happens, the danger zone could extend about three miles around the summit, land all inside the national park, Mandeville said. Fox News<U+2019> Frank Miles and Stephen Sorace, and The Associated Press, contributed to this report. <U+00A0> <U+00A0> <U+00A0> <U+00A0> <U+00A0>"

Now she's a billionaire Before she became a CEO, she was fired and laid off","Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen got into a lengthy, heated argument during a Cabinet meeting focused on immigration Wednesday, a source with knowledge of the blowup told CNN.  Trump was furious with Nielsen, telling her he didn't think she was doing enough to secure the border. But Nielsen stood her ground, citing the law in certain instances, the source said.  A separate White House official confirmed that Trump exploded over immigration in front of the Cabinet. The official described the remarks as ""angry and heated"" but also as fairly typical for Trump on this issue. The New York Times first reported on the blowup, saying Trump berated Nielsen to the point she told colleagues she was close to resigning after the incident. Two people told the Times that Nielsen, the Cabinet head who oversees agencies responsible for immigration enforcement and border security, drafted a resignation letter. Trump went on a ""lengthy tirade"" before the full Cabinet, the report said, but it added that Nielsen thought the thrust of Trump's remarks was about her.  A Department of Homeland Security spokesman flatly denied that Nielsen had threatened to resign. ""The @nytimes article alleging that the Secretary drafted a resignation letter yesterday and was close to resigning is false,"" the spokesman, Tyler Houlton, tweeted. ""The Secretary is hard at work today on the President's security-focused agenda and supporting the men and women of @DHSgov.""  White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in reaction to the report, ""The President is committed to fixing our broken immigration system and our porous borders. We are a country of laws and the president and his administration will enforce them.'' Nielsen said in a statement that she shares Trump's frustration about the border, blaming it in part on ""congressional inaction."" ""The President is rightly frustrated that existing loopholes and the lack of congressional action have prevented this administration from fully securing the border and protecting the American people. I share his frustration,"" Nielsen said. ""Border security is the most basic and necessary responsibility of a sovereign nation. These are complex issues and I will continue to direct the Department to do all we can to implement the President's security-focused agenda."" The report of Trump's angry remarks marked at least the second top Cabinet official Trump is said to have berated to the point they nearly quit. The Times reported last year that Trump called Attorney General Jeff Sessions an ""idiot"" to his face and said he should resign, and a source told CNN last year that Sessions offered to resign amid a series of heated exchanges with Trump.   Nielsen was picked to be secretary after her former boss at the department, John Kelly, was tapped to be Trump's chief of staff. Nielsen, who was Kelly's chief of staff, largely picked up where he left off at the department, including serving as the face of the President's aggressive immigration agenda. Trump and Kelly have also had an increasingly fraught relationship of late. Nielsen has served as the primary voice of Trump's immigration policy and has led the department in pursuing a number of hardline positions to crack down on illegal immigration and cut back on legal immigration. She has defended policies under criticism from Democrats in Congress, including a heated exchange with New Jersey's Sen. Cory Booker after she said she did not hear the President's comments in a meeting where he reportedly described immigrants coming from ""shithole countries.""  In recent weeks, with increased attention on the southern border and a ""caravan"" of migrants seeking asylum in the United States, Nielsen has announced that her department will refer any immigrant caught crossing the border illegally for prosecution, even if they may be making a valid asylum claim, which could result in the separation of thousands of parents from their children as they face charges.
