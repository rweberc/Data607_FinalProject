'Chilling political correctness': Gutfeld on professor facing discipline over 'corny' joke","Israel fires missiles at Iranian targets in Syria following Iran's first direct rocket attack on Israeli soldiers. The conflict comes two days following Trump's exit from nuclear deal. Israel and Iran reached the brink of full-scale war Thursday as the Islamic Republic's unprovoked rocket attack on soldiers in the Golan Heights gave way to an unprecedented Israeli counter-strike that targeted nearly all Iranian infrastructure inside Syria. The Israeli Defense Force said it deployed fighter jets and used missiles to strike a range of targets, including military compounds, intelligence operations and munitions warehouses, a statement read. The strikes were Israel's largest air operation in Syria since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. <U+201C>The IDF will not allow the Iranian threat to establish itself in Syria. The Syrian regime will be held accountable for everything happening in its territory,<U+201D> the press release read. <U+201C>The IDF is prepared for a wide variety of scenarios.<U+201D> Missile fire is seen from Damascus, Syria, May 10, 2018.

					         The missile launcher responsible for the Iranian rocket strikes was also destroyed, according to the release. The strikes came in response to Syria-based Iranian forces firing roughly 20 rockets at Israeli front-line military positions in the Golan Heights. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an IDF spokesman, called the attack ""the most severe attempt"" by Iran's Al Quds force to attack the country. It was the first time Iranian forces have attacked Israel from Syria, according to Reuters. Conricus said four rockets were intercepted and the others fell short of their targets. No injuries or damage was reported. The White House on Thursday condemned the Iranian assault, two days after President Trump announced he was pulling the U.S. out of the Iran nuke deal. ""The United States condemns the Iranian regime's provocative rocket attack from Syria against Israeli citizens, and we strongly support Israel's right to act in self-defense,"" Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. ""The Iranian regime's deployment into Syria of offensive rocket and missile systems aimed at Israel is an unacceptable and highly dangerous development for the entire Middle East."" Israel's rockets shook Damascus with the sounds of explosions just before dawn. Syria's state media said Syrian air defenses intercepted ""hostile Israeli missiles"" early Thursday that were fired over southwestern Damascus. Hours later, state-run Al-Ikhbariya TV broadcast a live feed of Syrian air defenses firing into the sky above the capital, and loud explosions and air defense firing were heard through the night. The footage could not be independently verified. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Israeli strikes killed 23 fighters, including five Syrian soldiers. Syria<U+2019>s military, however, said early Thursday the Israeli strikes killed three people, wounded two and destroyed a radar station and an ammunition warehouse and damaged a number of air defense units. Syrian Brig. Gen. Ali Mayhoub said Syrian air defense systems had intercepted <U+201C>the large part<U+201D> of the incoming Israeli strikes. There was no immediate information about Iranian casualties, but Conricus said the main intent was to target hardware rather than personnel. Tensions between Israel and Syria have been on the rise as Iran has sent thousands of troops to back Syrian President Bashar Assad from an insurgency in his country. Israel has warned it will not accept a permanent Iranian military presence in Syria.<U+00A0> Though Israel does not intend to further escalate the situation, Conricus said troops will remain on ""very high alert."" ""Should there be another Iranian attack, we will be prepared for it,"" he said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.<U+00A0> Benjamin Brown is a reporter for Fox News.

""The highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and myself will take place in Singapore on June 12th,"" Trump tweeted. ""We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!"" The summit, which has been in the works since Trump accepted Kim's invitation to meet in March, will be the first ever meeting between a sitting US president and North Korean leader. US officials had also considered holding the summit at the Korean demilitarized zone or in Mongolia, but ultimately settled on the city-state of Singapore as the location. CNN reported Wednesday Trump administration officials were moving forward with plans for the meeting to take place in Singapore. Leading choice Singapore was the early leading choice among top administration officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House chief of staff John Kelly, who from the beginning recognized that the summit location would play an outsized role in how the talks are viewed around the world.  Their chief concern was the appearance of neutrality -- both in the location's politics (no countries such as China or Russia that are seen as ""too communist"") and its geography. Logistics were a secondary but still major concern. Once Kim demonstrated he was willing to get on one of his airplanes to fly to China this week, officials were convinced Singapore -- some 3,000 miles from Pyongyang -- would work.  Trump last week said a date and time for the meeting had been set. But despite that, a location and date were not finalized until Pompeo met with the North Koreans. Both they and the South Korean government were pressing for talks at the DMZ and were encouraged by Trump's public endorsement of holding them there.  ""Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace House/Freedom House, on the Border of North & South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking!"" Trump had tweeted last week. His tweet caught aides off guard, since that site had been internally ruled out. Aides had been tasked with seeing whether Singapore could provide similarly celebratory atmospherics should the talks succeed.  Pompeo, Kelly and national security adviser John Bolton continued to argue that the DMZ could appear conciliatory to Kim and that he may get the wrong message if Trump traveled there. It took a couple weeks to dissuade him from the idea of holding the talks there, but eventually he came around to Singapore. Released prisoners The announcement came a day after North Korea released three imprisoned Americans during US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's most recent visit to Pyongyang. Beyond securing the release of the three Americans, Pompeo also finalized details for the upcoming summit between Trump and Kim. Trump has struck a cautiously optimistic tone in discussing the prospects of reaching a deal during his upcoming summit with Kim, saying he is hopeful a historic agreement can be brokered while also warning the talks could prove unfruitful. But the President saw the release of the three Americans as yet another reason for optimism as he prepares for the summit. ""We are starting off on a new footing -- I really think we have a very good chance of doing something very meaningful. A lot of very good things have happened,"" Trump said as he greeted the former prisoners at Joint Base Andrews early Thursday morning. ""I really think he wants to do something and bring the country into the real world,"" he added of Kim. ""It's never been taken this far, there has never been a relationship like this. I really think a lot of progress has been made."" "
