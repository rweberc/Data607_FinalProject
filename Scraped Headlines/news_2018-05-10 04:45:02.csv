When three Americans newly freed from detention in North Korea arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland early Thursday, President Donald Trump was there to greet them. The president was joined by first lady Melania Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.<U+00A0> A motorcade was waiting to take the three Korean-American detainees -- Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song and Tony Kim -- to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for physical examinations. The White House said earlier they would be evaluated and receive medical treatment at the Washington-area facility. Their families were not on hand for the ceremony. When the plane arrived from Alaska, where it stopped Wednesday after leaving North Korea, Trump and the first lady climbed aboard to greet the men and stayed there for several minutes. After the president emerged with the three Americans, he addressed the media, saying, ""I really think he [Kim Jong Un] wants to do something."" The former ""hostages,"" as Trump has called them, left North Korea early Wednesday, accompanied by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. ""This is a special night for these three really great people,"" Trump told reporters as he stood on the tarmac. On the U.S. relationship with North Korea, Trump said, ""We're starting off on a new footing."" The freed prisoners appeared tired but in excellent spirits, flashing peace signs as they emerged from the aircraft. They were joined by a translator who said ""it's like a dream"" and that the men were ""very, very happy"" to be freed.

					         North Korea had accused the detainees of anti-state activities. Their arrests were widely seen as politically motivated and compounded the dire state of U.S.-North Korea relations over the isolated nation<U+2019>s nuclear weapons. The three had been held for periods ranging between one and two years. They were the latest in a series of Americans who have been detained in North Korea in recent years for seemingly minor offenses. <U+201C>We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, and the people of the United States for bringing us home,<U+201D> the three said in an earlier statement released by the State Department. The three Americans and Pompeo flew on separate government planes because they received checkups during the flight from Japan and the larger plane was better equipped to accommodate the medical equipment. A U.S. official told Reuters that Singapore appears to be the likely meeting location for the<U+00A0>upcoming summit between Trump<U+00A0>and Kim. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Being fired from his job was the best thing that happened to this billionaire Bitcoin bull: 'Almost irresponsible' not to invest in it","Joint Base Andrews, Maryland (CNN)Under an American flag and dark night sky, US President Donald Trump personally welcomed home three American detainees Thursday morning after they were released from North Korea. The Americans -- Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak-song and Kim Sang Duk, also known as Tony Kim -- were freed Wednesday while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on a visit to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang to discuss President Trump's upcoming summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. No family members or friends of the three freed Americans were on hand for their arrival in the early hours of Thursday due to protocol reasons, an official told CNN, adding the men had to first debrief intelligence officials before heading to their homes.  RELATED: 13 hours hours in North Korea: How US prisoners were released Speaking to the media on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews Air Force Base, Kim Dong Chul said his release felt ""like a dream.""  ""We are very, very happy,"" said Kim. President Trump, who was accompanied by his wife Melania, told waiting reporters it was ""nice"" of the North Korean leader to release the three men ahead of their planned summit. ""Frankly we didn't think this was going to happen ... it's a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,"" he said.  Trump also said he wanted to pay his ""warmest respects"" to the family of Otto Warmbier, the American who was released by the North Koreans in a vegetative state, only to die days later. After their meeting with Trump, the three men will go to Walter Reed Medical Center in Maryland for further evaluation and medical treatment, according to White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.  President Trump is marking the men's arrival as a major milestone ahead of his upcoming historic summit with Kim Jong Un.  After addressing the return of the three American detainees, Trump was asked about the prospects of making a deal with the North Korean leader. ""I really think he wants to do something and bring his country into the real world,"" Trump said. ""I think this will be a very big success. It's never been taken this far, there's never been a relationship like this."" Trump has previously said the release of the three men was part of working towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. ""Some great things can happen, and that's what we hope,"" he added. Joking with reporters, Trump said the three men's arrivals had probably broken ""the all time in history television rating for three in the morning."" The US President had earlier said on his Twitter it would be ""quite a scene"" when the detainees arrived in Washington. The three men on Wednesday issued a joint statement thanking Trump saying, ""We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, and the people of the United States for bringing us home,"" the trio said in the statement which the State Department supplied to journalists traveling with Pompeo. Vice President Pence and his wife Karen Pence were also on hand to welcome the three men home.  Meeting planned for Singapore CNN reported Wednesday that administration officials have been instructed to move forward with plans to convene that meeting in Singapore, according to two people familiar with the plans.  Trump said on Wednesday he would announce the location and the timing of the summit in three days time, after repeatedly teasing the meeting date had been set. It will be the first meeting ever between a sitting US President and a North Korean leader, with both men meeting to discuss denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Other locations had been under discussion, including Mongolia and the Korean demilitarized zone, but experts said Singapore's neutral but opulent setting was likely to work in its favor. The White House Wednesday said they viewed the action to release the Americans as a ""gesture of good will."" "
