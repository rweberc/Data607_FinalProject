 Israel said it struck ""nearly all"" of the Iranian infrastructure sites in Syria on Thursday, in direct response to a barrage of Iranian rocket fire targeting Israeli military positions in the Golan Heights. The Israel Defense Force (IDF) said it deployed fighter jets that struck every target on its list. The targets included military compounds, intelligence operations and munition warehouses, a statement read. The strikes were Israel's largest air operation in years, the statement read. The missile launcher responsible for the Iranian rocket strikes was destroyed, according to the release.  Missile fire is seen from Damascus, Syria, May 10, 2018.

					         Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, called the roughly 20 missiles fired from Iranian forces based in Syria ""the most severe attempt"" by Iran's Al Quds force to attack the country. It was the first time Iranian forces have attacked Israel from Syria, according to Reuters. Conricus said four rockets were intercepted and the others fell short of their targets. No injuries or damage was reported. <U+201C>The IDF will not allow the Iranian threat to establish itself in Syria. The Syrian regime will be held accountable for everything happening in its territory,<U+201D> the press release read. <U+201C>The IDF is prepared for a wide variety of scenarios.<U+201D> Syria's state media said Syrian air defenses intercepted ""hostile Israeli missiles"" early Thursday that were fired over southwestern Damascus. Hours later, state-run Al-Ikhbariya TV broadcast a live feed of Syrian air defenses firing into the sky above the capital, and loud explosions and air defense firing were heard through the night. There was no immediate information about Iranian causalities, but Conricus said the main intent was to target hardware rather than personnel. Israel warned Russia ahead of the airstrikes on Thursday, according to Reuters. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just returned from a trip with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the ongoing situation in Syria, where Russia also has a military presence backing Assad. But Israel and Russia have maintained close communications to prevent their air forces from coming into conflict. Syrian media claimed earlier that the hostilities began with Israeli fire at Syrian positions in southern Syria from across the border, with Syrian forces then returning fire. Tensions between Israel and Syria have been on the rise as Iran has sent thousands of troops to back Syrian President Bashar Assad. Israel has warned it will not accept a permanent Iranian military presence in Syria. President Donald Trump<U+2019>s announcement on Tuesday to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal has also caused tensions to rise. Conricus said Israel does not intend to escalate the situation, but noted troops will remain on ""very high alert."" ""Should there be another Iranian attack, we will be prepared for it,"" he said.

Being fired from his job was the best thing that happened to this billionaire","Joint Base Andrews, Maryland (CNN)Under an American flag and dark night sky, US President Donald Trump personally welcomed home three American detainees Thursday morning after they were released from North Korea. The Americans -- Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak-song and Kim Sang Duk, also known as Tony Kim -- were freed Wednesday while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on a visit to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang to discuss President Trump's upcoming summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. No family members or friends of the three freed Americans were on hand for their arrival in the early hours of Thursday due to protocol reasons, an official told CNN, adding the men had to first debrief intelligence officials before heading to their homes.  Speaking to the media on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews Air Force Base, Kim Dong Chul said his release felt ""like a dream.""  ""We are very, very happy,"" said Kim. RELATED: 13 hours in North Korea: How US prisoners were released Trump: 'Nice' of Kim Jong Un to release men President Trump, who was accompanied by his wife Melania, told waiting reporters it was ""nice"" of the North Korean leader to release the three men ahead of their planned summit. ""Frankly we didn't think this was going to happen ... it's a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,"" he said.  Trump also said he wanted to pay his ""warmest respects"" to the family of Otto Warmbier, the American who was released by the North Koreans in a vegetative state, only to die days later. After their meeting with Trump, the three men were expected to go to the Walter Reed Medical Center in Maryland for further evaluation and medical treatment, according to White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.  After addressing the return of the three American detainees, Trump was asked about the prospects of making a deal with the North Korean leader. ""I really think he wants to do something and bring his country into the real world,"" Trump said. ""I think this will be a very big success. It's never been taken this far, there's never been a relationship like this."" Trump has previously said the release of the three men was part of working towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. ""Some great things can happen, and that's what we hope,"" he added. Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen Pence were also on hand to welcome the three men home.  Joking with reporters, Trump said the three men's arrivals had probably broken ""the all time in history television rating for three in the morning."" The US President had earlier said on his Twitter it would be ""quite a scene"" when the detainees arrived in Washington. Detainees still in North Korean custody Rumors had swirled for days around the possibility North Korea might release the three Americans ahead of the summit, especially once Pompeo's visit to Pyongyang was revealed. Trump had demurred on how likely their return was, telling reporters on Tuesday ""we'll all soon be finding out."" ""It would be a great thing if they are,"" he added. The three former detainees issued a joint statement on Wednesday thanking Trump for their release. ""We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, and the people of the United States for bringing us home,"" the trio said. While both South Korea and Japan welcomed the news of the Americans' release, the two countries are still waiting for word on their own citizens held or abducted by North Korea. In a statement Wednesday, South Korean government spokesman Yoon Young-chan called again for Kim Jong Un to release the six South Koreans still held by the North. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has repeatedly pushed for Trump to raise the issue of repeated abductions of Japanese citizens by North Korea in his upcoming meeting with Kim Jong Un. More than a dozen abductees still remain missing, according to the Japanese government. Meeting planned for Singapore CNN reported Wednesday that administration officials have been instructed to move forward with plans to convene that meeting in Singapore, according to two people familiar with the plans.  Trump said on Wednesday he would announce the location and the timing of the summit in three days time, after repeatedly teasing the meeting date had been set. The two leaders are expected to meet sometime in June. It will be the first meeting ever between a sitting US President and a North Korean leader, with both men meeting to discuss denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Other locations had been under discussion, including Mongolia and the Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ), but experts said Singapore's neutral but opulent setting was likely to work in its favor. It comes less than two months after a historic summit between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in on April 27 in the DMZ, where Kim became the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South since 1953. The White House Wednesday said they viewed the action to release the Americans as a ""gesture of good will."" "
