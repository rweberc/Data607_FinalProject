President Trump told supporters in Indiana Thursday evening that the U.S. would not agree to a redux of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal when he sits down with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Singapore next month. ""I think it's going to be a very big success,"" Trump told a rally in Elkhart, ""and if it isn't, it isn't. We're not going to be walked into an Iran deal where the negotiator, [then-Secretary of State] John Kerry, refused to leave the table."" Trump spoke two days after he announced that the U.S. was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear accord, which was negotiated by the U.S. and five other world powers along with the Tehran regime. ""The Iran deal was one of the most embarrassing agreements the United States has ever entered into,"" said Trump, who added that the U.S. ""cannot allow [Iran] to have nuclear weapons."" <U+2013><U+2013> ADVERTISEMENT <U+2013><U+2013> TRUMP SLAMS 'CRYIN' CHUCK SCHUMER' FOR IRAN DEAL FLIP-FLOP ""We have to be able to go into their military bases to see whether or not they<U+2019>re cheating,"" he said before adding sarcastically, ""Now, of course we<U+2019>re all sure they<U+2019>re not cheating, but just in case."" The president also said that the relationship between the U.S. and North Korea is ""good"" and praised Kim for agreeing to the release of three American detainees, whom Trump greeted at Andrews Air Force Base early Thursday, as a prelude to the summit. ""I think that Kim Jong Un did a great service to himself, to his country, by doing this,"" said Trump, who added ""we're going to set the table, we're going to make a great deal for the world, for North Korea, for South Korea, for Japan, for China. So what he did was the right thing."" TRUMP GREETS AMERICAN DETAINEES FREED FROM NORTH KOREA Trump traveled to Indiana two days after Republican voters nominated former state lawmaker Mike Braun to challenge vulnerable Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, whom the president dubbed ""Sleepin' Joe."" Trump said Donnelly would ""do whatever Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi tell him to do."" Donnelly, Trump said, will ""say one thing in Elkhart"" and then support the ""radical, liberal agenda. It never, ever fails."" ""This November, Indiana will face an important choice: You can send a really incredible swamp person back to the Senate like Joe Donnelly,"" the president said, ""or you can send us Republicans like Mike Braun to drain the swamp."" At one point, Braun took the stage to say a few words, casting himself in the mold of Trump. ""I<U+2019>m a businessman and an outsider, just like our president,"" Braun said. ""And you can count on me to be a true reinforcement and the guy that is going to retire Joe Donnelly."" Trump touted strong economic numbers during his appearance, but also warned his audience that ""all of the great momentum that we<U+2019>re having as a country; on jobs on safety, on security, on our military, it<U+2019>s all at stake in November."" PELOSI SAYS DEMS WILL WORK TO ROLL BACK TRUMP TAX CUTS IF THEY RETAKE CONGRESS He also brought up Pelosi's statement this week that her party would try to undo tax cuts passed by Republicans last year. ""I don<U+2019>t think her party was too happy,"" Trump said. ""But you know what? That<U+2019>s her thought, that<U+2019>s what they want to do. They want to raise your taxes [and] end your tax cuts, they want to have open borders where everyone flies into our country."" ""The strides that we<U+2019>re making have never, ever been made like this before,"" the president added. ""But it can also disappear if you put fools and if you put the wrong people in [office]. ... You have to work every day between now and November to elect more Republicans so that we can continue making America great again."" The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Now she's a billionaire Before she became a CEO, she was fired and laid off"," (CNN)President Donald Trump was working to project party unity and forward momentum during a political rally in Elkhart, Indiana, on Thursday night after a bitter GOP primary battle in the state earlier this week. Almost immediately after taking the stage inside a packed middle school gymnasium, Trump hailed his recent foreign policy accomplishments, including securing the release of three American prisoners from North Korea. ""America is being respected again,"" Trump proclaimed to cheers.  He said the relationship between the US and North Korea was ""good."" ""You remember everybody in the fake news, when they were saying he's going to get us into a nuclear war?"" he said to boos. ""And you know what gets you into nuclear wars, and you know what gets you into other wars? Weakness."" Trump traveled to Elkhart two days after former state Rep. Mike Braun secured his place on the November ballot against the vulnerable Democratic incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly. Braun beat out two sitting congressmen in a surprise upset. Trump also hailed economic improvements in the country -- a potent topic in Elkhart, which then-President Barack Obama visited in 2009 only days into his term. Obama returned to the town, a hub of recreational vehicle manufacturing, in 2016. Campaigning against Donnelly For Trump, the rally provided an opportunity to hit at Donnelly, who represented a district that included Elkhart during his time in the US House. Trump railed against Democrats and Donnelly in particular, and he brought out Braun to address the crowd. ""We need Mike Braun in the Senate,"" Trump said, adding later, ""Now if Joe Donnelly, Sleepin' Joe, and the Democrats get back into power, remember what I said, they will raise your taxes. ... They will destroy your jobs, and they are going to knock the hell out of your borders.""  Trump took issue with Donnelly's voting record and dinged his vote for ""failed Obamacare."" Trump teased something new on health care soon and touted the repeal of the law's individual mandate last year. ""Wait till you see the plans we have coming out literally over the next four weeks,"" Trump said. ""We have great health care plans coming out.""  Trump is expected to assume a larger role on the campaign trail in coming months as Republicans work to retain control of the House and Senate.  "
