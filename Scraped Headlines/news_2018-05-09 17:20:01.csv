California has become the first state in the nation to mandate solar panels for all new homes, in a move to cut greenhouse gas emissions that critics say will end up raising home prices in the already expensive market.<U+00A0> In a unanimous 5-0 vote Wednesday, the California Energy Commission approved the policy.<U+00A0> The regulation will require all homes and apartments built after 2020 to have solar panels, adding an average of roughly $10,000 to construction costs for a single-family home. On the flip side, the commission says, the panels could yield much more in energy savings. Spokeswoman for the Energy Commission Amber Beck told Fox News that under the new standards, new homes would be expected to reduce energy use by more than 50 percent. She argued that the change will lead to savings in the long run.<U+00A0> <U+201C>For residential homeowners, based on a 30-year mortgage, the Energy Commission estimates that the standards will add about $40 to an average monthly payment, but save consumers $80 on monthly heating, cooling, and lighting bills,<U+201D> Beck said in a statement. <U+201C>On average the 2019 standards will increase the cost of constructing a new home by about $9,500 but will save $19,000 in energy and maintenance costs over 30 years.<U+201D> Few industry groups outwardly oppose the plan after working for years with the commission to shape the regulations. But Republican legislative leaders said Californians can't afford to pay any more for housing in the state's already expensive market. ""That's just going to drive the cost up and make California, once again, not affordable to live,"" said Assemblyman Brian Dahle, the chamber's Republican leader.<U+00A0> The solar panel decision is just the latest example of what critics see as the state<U+2019>s ever-evolving nanny-state policies. California often is at the leading edge of government mandates and bans, having recently prohibited everything from plastic bags to foie gras <U+2013> and even flirting with phasing out internal combustion engines. Bill Watt, a homebuilder and design consultant, told The Orange County Register the added solar panel costs, in addition to other building mandates, will make homeownership out of reach for many buyers. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re not building enough housing already,<U+201D> Watt, former president of the Orange County Building Industry Association, told The OCR. <U+201C>Why not just pause for a little while, focus on the affordability and housing issues, then circle back?<U+201D> Despite the increase in construction costs, the California Building Industry Association generally supports the plan, but expressed a preference to delay the launch. <U+201C>[W]e would prefer that this had been put off for a few more years, but the fact is that the California Energy Commission has been working on this, with us, for the past 10 years,<U+201D> the association<U+2019>s technical director, Robert Raymer, said in a statement, noting that the group worked with the state<U+2019>s energy commission to alter the policy. <U+201C>We know this is coming, we did everything we could to push down compliance costs and increase design flexibility.<U+201D> The mandate is the latest win for the solar industry, despite past controversies tied to companies' use of taxpayer funds.<U+00A0> The most notorious example was California company<U+00A0>Solyndra, which filed for bankruptcy in 2011. An Energy Department inspector general report in 2015 said the company misrepresented facts in order to secure a $535 million loan guarantee from the federal government. Taxpayer lost most of that money in the deal.<U+00A0> The new California measure would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 700,000 metric tons over three years, according to the commission. The Energy Commission said this would be equivalent to taking 115,000 cars off the road. The Associated Press contributed to this report.<U+00A0> Brooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Over the course of the 90-minute meal, according to people familiar with it, Trump repeatedly reminded French President Emmanuel Macron of the promises the American made to his voters -- not just to quit the Iran nuclear deal, which Macron had traveled from Paris to save, but to wind down US involvement in the Middle East and escalate pressure on North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Macron, who later relayed the conversation to aides, walked away increasingly sure Trump would scrap the Iran accord, just as he'd repeatedly vowed to do as a candidate. But it was also clear, 15 months into his tenure, that Trump was more willing than ever to shatter ties with America's closest allies to make good on his ""America First"" pledge. Trump's decisions over the past months, and the moves he's planning in the coming weeks, have shaped the global stage in his image and shaken long-standing geopolitical forces. His imprint on the world is being felt in remarkable and often head-spinning ways, delighting his supporters and alarming his critics who fear a chaotic fallout from his actions. Far-reaching diplomacy Hardly a student of diplomacy before taking office, Trump is influencing the world in far-reaching ways for a new American president. His actions reflect an emboldened commander in chief no longer restrained by aides or conventions he considered outmoded or misguided. A day after announcing his withdrawal from the Iran deal, Trump proclaimed on Twitter that his secretary of state was jetting home from North Korea with three ex-prisoners, greasing the path for his upcoming summit with Kim Jong Un. On Monday, a US embassy will open in Jerusalem, overturning decades of US policy that refused to recognize the city as Israel's capital. And the top economic aide to Chinese President Xi Jinping is due in Washington next week as Trump continues to cause shockwaves on global trade. Over the past month, Trump has engaged in a marathon of diplomacy, including hosting his first state visit, for Macron, and welcoming a parade of other leaders to the White House. He's set to meet with South Korea's president later this month. In early June he's expected in Canada for his second G7 meeting, where European leaders humiliated by his withdrawal from the Iran deal will benefit from a six-on-one dynamic. He'll also visit Britain in July after delaying a visit for more than a year. Mass protests are planned. Trump enters the fray having shed aides who had cautioned him against some of the decisions he ultimately made. His ex-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former national security adviser H.R. McMaster both successfully counseled Trump to remain in the Iran deal when they were on the job. But their insistence on sticking to the plan aggravated Trump and played a role in both men's downfalls. This time around, there were fewer detractors. Defense Secretary James Mattis, who had argued during previous deliberations that a withdrawal could harm US alliances, did not offer a vocal case for remaining in the agreement this time around, people familiar with the deliberations said. Mike Pompeo, who replaced Tillerson as Trump's top diplomat, pressed for a longer negotiating period with European allies and a more phased withdrawal. Trump ultimately jettisoned that advice.   Iran deal withdrawal Although few within the administration ever doubted Trump would ultimately exit the Iran accord, preparations for Tuesday's announcement stretched through the weekend and into Monday, White House officials said. The precise policy prescriptions of the withdrawal were still in flux as recently as late last week, the officials said. Trump spent the last few the weeks calling staffers early in the morning and late at night to hammer out details of the decision, one White House official said, and was more involved than usual in the speech-writing process heading into the announcement this week. In the 48 hours leading up to the event, Trump hand-wrote notes in the margins of speech drafts and dictated other changes to staffers working on the remarks. People involved in the process said the atypical involvement reflected Trump's belief the Iran announcement would signal a new era of campaign promises fulfilled; just weeks earlier, he had thrown the text of a different speech in the air and called it ""boring"" at a tax reform event in West Virginia -- a marked departure from the attention sources said Trump paid to his speech about the Iran deal. Republicans have insisted it's the tax cuts that will provide them momentum in November's midterm elections. But Trump is more convinced the showmanship he's demonstrated in foreign affairs will help propel the GOP, according to people who have spoken with him. North Korean talks He's lent the North Korea talks an air of spectacle, from teasing the location to demanding the optics be as momentous as a summit last month between Kim and South Korea's Moon Jae-in. Early Thursday he'll travel to a darkened tarmac at Joint Base Andrews to welcome US citizens just released from captivity in North Korea. ""I look forward to seeing you -- probably, some of you, maybe a lot of you,"" Trump told reporters. ""It'll be two o'clock in the morning. It'll be quite a scene."" He also presented uncharacteristic modesty when asked whether he was owed a Nobel Peace Prize for his work toward ending the North Korean nuclear crisis -- a prospect that Trump has raised frequently in private, despite his humility before cameras. ""Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it,"" Trump said with a grin. ""You know what I want to do? I want to get it finished. The prize I want is victory for the world."" It's an open question how the biggest diplomatic gamble of his presidency will turn out, but there's little question that Trump is driving the global discussion. While many of his peers have seen their statures diminished by controversies at home, Trump's standing has risen, despite scandal, investigation and unpopularity among a majority of Americans. Trump's approval rating on foreign affairs topped 40% for the first time since April 2017 in a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS. But a majority of Americans -- 51% -- still disapprove of how he's handled his foreign portfolio. "
