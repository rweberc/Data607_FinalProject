                                    Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was busy rescuing American detainees from North Korea when The New York Times complained he wasn<U+2019>t around for Trump<U+2019>s Iran deal announcement.

                                 As the New York Times was bashing Mike Pompeo for being<U+00A0>missing in action while President Trump tore up the Iran nuclear deal, it turned out the secretary of state was busy rescuing three Americans<U+00A0>who have been held captive in North Korea. In an apparent jab at the administration, The Times<U+2019> headline said, <U+201C>At a Key Moment, Trump<U+2019>s Top Diplomat Is Again Thousands of Miles Away.<U+201D> The Times<U+2019> story noted that <U+201C>Senior State Department officials were momentarily speechless on Tuesday when asked why Mr. Pompeo did not delay his trip by a day to be in Washington during Mr. Trump<U+2019>s Iran deal announcement.<U+201D> It became clear on Wednesday morning why Pompeo didn<U+2019>t delay his trip to Pyongyang<U+00A0>when Trump took to Twitter. <U+201C>I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health,<U+201D> Trump wrote. <U+201C>Secretary Pompeo and his <U+2018>guests<U+2019> will be landing at Andrews Air Force Base at 2:00 A.M. in the morning. I will be there to greet them. Very exciting!<U+201D> The Times story noted that Pompeo was expected to return from his trip with the detainees in the caption of a photo accompanying the story, so it's curious why the headline attempted to paint his trip in a negative light. The New York Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The story, written by Gardiner Harris, focused on Trump<U+2019>s top diplomat being absent when Trump <U+201C>made what could be the most significant diplomatic announcement of his presidency<U+201D> by pulling out of the Iran nuclear agreement. <U+201C>The absence of Mr. Pompeo and other top State Department officials left perplexed European diplomats privately complaining that they were having trouble getting answers from Washington,<U+201D> Harris wrote. The Times story also mocked Pompeo<U+2019>s plane, reporting that it <U+201C>has such poor equipment that calls are often dropped midsentence.<U+201D> It turned out that Pompeo<U+2019>s absence was more than justified, and any aging technology on his plane didn<U+2019>t prevent him from leaving Pyongyang<U+00A0>with three Americans that have been held captive oversees. The detaniees -- Tony Kim, Kim Hak Song and Kim Dong Chul -- are presumably thankful that Pompeo didn<U+2019>t push back his trip to satisfy European diplomats In addition to rescuing three Americans, Pompeo<U+00A0>also helped arrange a date and location for Trump<U+2019>s meeting with Kim Jong Un, according to Trump.
