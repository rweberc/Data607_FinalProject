Classified records being sought by House Republicans relating to a secret intelligence source are considered to be as significant to their Russia investigation as the controversial anti-Trump dossier, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News. The focus on the FBI intelligence source<U+2019>s role has also led to renewed interest by congressional investigators in August 2017 Senate testimony from Glenn Simpson, whose firm, Fusion GPS, commissioned the dossier. At the time, Simpson testified that former British spy and dossier author Christopher Steele had told him the FBI had intelligence from an <U+201C>internal Trump campaign source.<U+201D> It is not clear, however, whether Simpson was referring to the same source now at the center of a high-stakes power struggle between House Republicans and the Justice Department, the FBI and intelligence officials <U+2013> or whether that source was in any way in contact with the Trump campaign. But the Justice Department took a step toward trying to reach a resolution when top officials met Thursday with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy. The Republican chairmen met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and his deputy Ed O'Callahan, as well as representatives from the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, to discuss their request for records. The meeting was brokered after Nunes issued a subpoena on April 30 for records relating to the intelligence source. <U+00A0> The meeting appeared to, at least for now, ease tensions between the DOJ and the lawmakers, who are investigating surveillance abuse during the 2016 campaign.<U+00A0> <U+201C>We had a productive discussion today with officials from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Department of Justice, and FBI in which we raised questions related to information requested from the intelligence community,"" Nunes and Gowdy said in a statement. ""The officials committed to holding further discussions of these matters, and we look forward to continuing our dialogue next week to satisfy the committee<U+2019>s request.<U+201D> A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that Gowdy and Nunes were briefed <U+201C>about the documents<U+201D> but not permitted to view them. They expect to see the documents at a meeting next week and, according to the source, <U+201C>either senior DOJ leadership is going to tell them what they are asking about, or [DOJ is] going to have a big problem.<U+201D> Nunes and Gowdy have been looking into how the unverified anti-Trump dossier was used to secure a surveillance warrant for Trump campaign aide Carter Page. The dossier contained salacious allegations about Trump and his associates, and was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. But the focus is now on records pertaining to the intelligence source. The Washington Post has<U+00A0>reported the individual is a <U+201C>sensitive, longtime intelligence source<U+201D> for the CIA and FBI who has helped in Robert Mueller<U+2019>s special counsel investigation, and says officials worry disclosure of the documents could jeopardize the source. A source close to the matter said Simpson<U+2019>s 2017 testimony has attracted renewed interest in connection with this. At the time, he spoke to the Senate Judiciary Committee <U+2013> and top committee Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein made the transcripts public in January. When Simpson was asked about his contact with Steele, Simpson told investigators what Steele relayed to him about a September 2016 meeting with the FBI: ""Essentially what [Steele] told me was they had other intelligence about this matter from an internal Trump campaign source and that <U+2026> my understanding was that [the FBI] believed Chris at this point -- that they believed Chris's information might be credible because they had other intelligence that indicated the same thing, and one of those pieces of intelligence was a human source from inside the Trump organization.<U+201D> There has been previous speculation about this section of the Simpson interview. Earlier this year, anonymous sources suggested to other media outlets that Simpson could have been referring to former Trump adviser George Papadopoulos -- who later pleaded guilty to lying to investigators -- or an Australian diplomat. Fox News has reached out to Simpson for additional comment on his testimony. Investigators want to determine whether his remarks are relevant to the current records request. House Speaker Paul Ryan, meanwhile, is backing Nunes and Gowdy in their pursuit of the records. <U+201C>I think this request is wholly appropriate. It's completely within the scope of the investigation that's been ongoing for a while with respect to FISA,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>I actually think that this is something that probably should have been answered a while ago.<U+201D> A Justice Department spokeswoman said, <U+201C>We welcome the opportunity to discuss whether there are other ways to accommodate [Nunes<U+2019>]<U+00A0>inquiry regarding a specific individual.<U+201D> Fox News<U+2019> John Roberts, Jake Gibson, Alex Pappas and Cyd Upson<U+00A0>contributed to this report.

Now she's a billionaire The $2 billion food startup you've never heard of"," (CNN)One day after Rudy Giuliani announced he was leaving his law firm to offer his ""sole concentration"" to President Donald Trump, Giuliani appeared in a Broward County, Florida, courtroom Friday to represent a woman accused in an insurance fraud case.  The former New York City mayor, who recently joined Trump's legal team, appeared for a morning hearing for a criminal defendant. According to court documents, the defendant was in a car crash on May 18, 2016, in Broward County. She is accused of fraudulently purchasing auto insurance online just 10 minutes after the crash and providing false and misleading information to the insurance company. Two people confirmed Giuliani appeared in court, including Constance Simmons, the public information officer for the state's 17th Judicial Circuit. Steve Rossi, the lead Florida attorney representing the defendant, told CNN over the phone Friday that he had never worked with Giuliani before. Asked why the President's attorney is getting involved in an insurance fraud case in Florida, Rossi said Giuliani knows the woman and her family. ""I consider it an honor to have a historical and political icon assisting me on this case,"" Rossi said. ""He is here to help me out and offer his assistance and I more than graciously accepted it."" Rossi added that Giuliani did not mention anything about the President or the fact that he is Trump's lawyer in court. Giuliani was ""his usual cordial self,"" Rossi said. Giuliani is licensed to practice law in New York but not in Florida, according to court documents. The former New York City mayor requested to work on this case about two weeks after it was announced that he would be joining Trump's legal team, court documents show. He was granted that request May 8.  Reached Friday afternoon, Giuliani said the case was not related to his work for the President. ""This is a private client,"" he told CNN. ""I did it as a favor.""  He described it as a ""minor case"" that only took up a half hour in court Friday morning. ""I'm cleaning up my law business so I can focus on the President,"" Giuliani said. Politico Playbook reported earlier Friday that Giuliani had been spotted at the Broward County courthouse. Giuliani told Playbook that his business there ""had nothing to do with the President.""  Trump's legal team didn't comment for this story.  The defendant, Vanessa Ryan, could not be reached for comment. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The affidavit states that after Ryan bought her insurance based on false information, she then filed a fraudulent insurance claim the next day. In requesting permission to work on the case, Giuliani listed the Manhattan address of his law firm, Greenberg Traurig, as the location of his office. Giuliani announced Thursday that he had offered a ""permanent resignation"" from Greenberg Traurig, following what was initially a temporary leave of absence from the firm. ""In light of the pressing demands of the Mueller investigation, I believe it is in everyone's best interest that I make it a permanent resignation,"" Giuliani said in a statement, referring to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible Russian collusion in the 2016 election. ""This way, my sole concentration can be on this critically important matter for our country."" Richard Rosenbaum, the executive chairman of Greenberg Traurig, said in a statement that there was a recognition that Giuliani's work for Trump was ""all consuming and is lasting longer than previously anticipated."" A spokesperson for Greenberg Traurig responded, ""This is not a firm matter,"" when CNN asked about the law firm's role -- if any -- in the case. Attorney Mike Gottlieb was in the courtroom for a separate case and heard the judge call for Rossi, who was not in the room at the time. ""All of the sudden, in walks this elder statesmen type guy surrounded by about 10 armed guards,"" Gottlieb said. ""That's when I knew something was afoot."" CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report."
