Classified records being sought by House Republicans relating to a secret intelligence source are considered to be as significant to their Russia investigation as the controversial anti-Trump dossier, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News. The focus on the FBI intelligence source<U+2019>s role has also led to renewed interest by congressional investigators in August 2017 Senate testimony from Glenn Simpson, whose firm, Fusion GPS, commissioned the dossier. At the time, Simpson testified that former British spy and dossier author Christopher Steele had told him the FBI had intelligence from an <U+201C>internal Trump campaign source.<U+201D> It is not clear, however, whether Simpson was referring to the same source now at the center of a high-stakes power struggle between House Republicans and the Justice Department, the FBI and intelligence officials <U+2013> or whether that source was in any way in contact with the Trump campaign. But the Justice Department took a step toward trying to reach a resolution when top officials met Thursday with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy. The Republican chairmen met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and his deputy Ed O'Callahan, as well as representatives from the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, to discuss their request for records. The meeting was brokered after Nunes issued a subpoena on April 30 for records relating to the intelligence source. <U+00A0> The meeting appeared to, at least for now, ease tensions between the DOJ and the lawmakers, who are investigating surveillance abuse during the 2016 campaign.<U+00A0> <U+201C>We had a productive discussion today with officials from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Department of Justice, and FBI in which we raised questions related to information requested from the intelligence community,"" Nunes and Gowdy said in a statement. ""The officials committed to holding further discussions of these matters, and we look forward to continuing our dialogue next week to satisfy the committee<U+2019>s request.<U+201D> A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that Gowdy and Nunes were briefed <U+201C>about the documents<U+201D> but not permitted to view them.  They expect to see the documents at a meeting next week and, according to the source, <U+201C>either senior DOJ leadership is going to tell them what they are asking about, or [DOJ is] going to have a big problem.<U+201D> Nunes and Gowdy have been looking into how the unverified anti-Trump dossier was used to secure a surveillance warrant for Trump campaign aide Carter Page. The dossier contained salacious allegations about Trump and his associates, and was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. But the focus is now on records pertaining to the intelligence source. The Washington Post has<U+00A0>reported the individual is a <U+201C>sensitive, longtime intelligence source<U+201D> for the CIA and FBI who has helped in Robert Mueller<U+2019>s special counsel investigation, and says officials worry disclosure of the documents could jeopardize the source. A source close to the matter said Simpson<U+2019>s 2017 testimony has attracted renewed interest in connection with this. At the time, he spoke to the Senate Judiciary Committee <U+2013> and top committee Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein made the transcripts public in January. When Simpson was asked about his contact with Steele, Simpson told investigators what Steele relayed to him about a September 2016 meeting with the FBI: ""Essentially what [Steele] told me was they had other intelligence about this matter from an internal Trump campaign source and that <U+2026> my understanding was that [the FBI] believed Chris at this point -- that they believed Chris's information might be credible because they had other intelligence that indicated the same thing, and one of those pieces of intelligence was a human source from inside the Trump organization.<U+201D> There has been previous speculation about this section of the Simpson interview. Earlier this year, anonymous sources suggested to other media outlets that Simpson could have been referring to former Trump adviser George Papadopoulos -- who later pleaded guilty to lying to investigators -- or an Australian diplomat. Fox News has reached out to Simpson for additional comment on his testimony. Investigators want to determine whether his remarks are relevant to the current records request. House Speaker Paul Ryan, meanwhile, is backing Nunes and Gowdy in their pursuit of the records. <U+201C>I think this request is wholly appropriate. It's completely within the scope of the investigation that's been ongoing for a while with respect to FISA,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>I actually think that this is something that probably should have been answered a while ago.<U+201D> A Justice Department spokeswoman said, <U+201C>We welcome the opportunity to discuss whether there are other ways to accommodate [Nunes<U+2019>]<U+00A0>inquiry regarding a specific individual.<U+201D> Fox News<U+2019> John Roberts, Jake Gibson and Alex Pappas contributed to this report.

Then she invented Spanx. Now she's a billionaire The $2 billion food startup you've never heard of"," (CNN)On Thursday morning, a White House aide named Kelly Sadler joked about Arizona Sen. John McCain's opposition to CIA nominee Gina Haspel by noting that ""he's dying anyway."" It was the latest in a series of increasingly nasty comments about McCain: Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) called it ""ridiculous"" that McCain wasn't planning to invite President Donald Trump to his funeral while a retired general on Fox News on Thursday referred to a debunked conspiracy theory that McCain had informed on his comrades while a prisoner of war during Vietnam. There's no disputing the fact that McCain has terminal brain cancer and that he is very unlikely to be around at this time next year. It's also indisputable that McCain is a genuine American hero -- who fought and suffered for his country in the theater of war and had decided the better part of the last four decades of his life to public service as a House member, a senator and a two-time presidential candidate. That even some part of his final days -- or weeks or months -- is consumed by this sort of garbage is maddening. And depressing. And made even more so by the fact that this is, in fact, the new normal. How did we get here? Where anyone who disagrees with us on anything is evil, other and an object for ridicule? Where the phrase ""reasonable people can disagree"" has lost all meaning? Where someone can feel comfortable making a death joke about a man battling brain cancer? Lots of people would like to lay the blame -- all of it -- at the feet of Trump. The reality is more complex. Our own self-sorting tendencies -- we rarely live around anyone anymore who doesn't see the world generally as we do -- played a role. The expansion of ideological media where you can only watch, read and listen to people who validate you and your views played a role. The rise of outside political groups who made a business out of purifying the two parties of any so-called moderates played a role. The partisan redistricting processes around the country, which jammed us into congressional seats prioritized by political party played a role. That said, there is no question that Trump -- the campaign he ran in 2016 and the way he has acted in the White House since winning -- has been the prime catalyst for this degradation in our ability to simply treat people with whom we disagree with respect.  There was already lots of gasoline on the ground. Trump lit the match and dropped it. Trump's campaign was based on a simple idea: Politicians are too political. They're afraid of their own shadows. They won't say it like it is because they live in fear of the political correctness police coming to knock on their door.  He cast himself as the antidote to all of that -- someone who would say what everyone was thinking. He was a status quo shaker, the worst nightmare for the staid and ineffective political establishment. That idea, in and of itself, is powerful.  The problem was -- and is -- that Trump conflated insults and bullying with shaking things up. So, questioning McCain's war credentials -- ""He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured."" -- as Trump did in July 2015, at the start of his presidential campaign, was somehow treated by Trump and those who supported him as speaking truth to power. Ditto his attacks on Carly Fiorina's looks. His attempts to raise the heritage of Judge Gonzalo Curiel. His suggestion that Khizr Khan, the father of a solider fighting in Iraq, had been put up to his speech at the Democratic National Convention by partisans out to get him. His suggestion, as President, that ""both sides"" were to blame for the white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. His repeated bullying of his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and his comments about the alleged plastic surgery of ""Morning Joe"" anchor Mika Brzezinski. On and on the list goes. And it all adds up to one thing: Trump weaponized nastiness and bullying. He turned it into a political art form. He gave cover for all of those people with uninformed views -- on race, ethnicity and everything else -- to emerge from the shadows and speak out. And, if you didn't laugh or ""get the joke,"" -- even though Trump was often not joking in these circumstances -- you were part of the problem. Just another defender of a status quo that rewarded elites and left out the little guy. Just another person who didn't get it. The issue with all of this is that it bastardized a very legitimate issue -- the growing income (and everything else) gap between the rich and the poor -- for Trump's own political purposes. He drove the divide for political reasons and, in his language, made it totally OK to say whatever you wanted about people you disagreed with because they had been out to get you for years. This was just payback. And man did they deserve it. Nuance went out the window. Speaking hard truths that the country needed to hear -- as McCain has done throughout his career -- became indistinguishable from calling Sen. Ted Cruz's wife ugly or suggesting that we need to ban Muslims from entering the country. Political incorrectness became a crutch to justify racist and xenophobic views.  And, in the middle of it all was Trump. When he wasn't engaging in these behaviors, he was refusing to condemn them -- an example of his abdication of the idea of the President as moral leader. Who am I to say who is right and who is wrong in the Charlottesville violence, Trump asked.  Who am I to judge who is telling the truth -- Roy Moore or the multiple women who said he had pursued relationships with them when they were teenagers? That view has trickled down. When CNN's Chris Cuomo asked State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert on Friday to comment on the ""joke"" about McCain's death, Nauert responded: ""I'm not familiar with what you're familiar with."" Really? Nauert hadn't heard about the story? I find that very, very hard to believe. That collective shrug from the President of the United States and his allies coupled with the extant factors of our internal divisions and the sort of campaign he ran in 2016 created the toxic stew from which comments like the one Thursday by Sadler grow.  No one is standing up and saying ""We can't treat people like this."" And sadly, that vacuum in moral leadership means that the better angels of our nature are being drown out by our demons. "
