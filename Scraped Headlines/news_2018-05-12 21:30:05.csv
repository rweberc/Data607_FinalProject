The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote Friday to the FBI and Department of Justice, pushing the agencies for answers about the interview of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, citing an <U+201C>apparently contradiction<U+201D> between what former FBI Director James Comey said to the committee, and what he has said since. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, sent the letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, saying that in a March 2017 briefing, Comey told lawmakers that <U+201C>the agents saw no change in his demeanor or tone that would say [Flynn] was being untruthful<U+201D> about the contents of a call with the then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. According to committee staff, Comey also said that the FBI agents <U+201C>saw nothing that led them to believe [he was] lying.<U+201D> But Flynn later pleaded guilty in Special Counsel Robert Mueller<U+2019>s Russia probe to making false statements to the FBI in that interview. He also lost his job at the White House after he was said to have misled Vice President Mike Pence about the discussion with Kislyak. HOUSE INTEL REPORT: COMEY TESTIFIED FBI AGENTS SAW NO 'PHYSICAL INDICATIONS OF DECEPTION' BY FLYNN <U+2013><U+2013> ADVERTISEMENT <U+2013><U+2013> Last week, the release of a less-redacted version of House Intelligence Committee Republicans<U+2019> Russia report showed that Comey told that committee that agents who interviewed Flynn <U+201C>discerned no physical indications of deception.<U+201D> <U+201C>They saw nothing that indicated to them that he knew he was lying to them,<U+201D> Comey said, according to the GOP-authored report. Former deputy director Andrew McCabe made similar statements, raising the possibility that Flynn may not have knowingly lied about asking Kislyak to refrain from responding to U.S. sanctions during the transition. Comey has suggested he was misunderstood. <U+201C>No, I saw that in the media,<U+201D> Comey said earlier this month on Fox News<U+2019> <U+201C>Special Report.<U+201D> <U+201C>Someone misunderstood something I said. I didn<U+2019>t believe that and didn<U+2019>t say that.<U+201D> Grassley<U+2019>s letter zones in on comments Comey has made, arguing that conflicts with what Comey told the Senate committee. <U+201C>Contrary to his public statements during his current book tour denying any memory of those comments, then-Director Comey led us to believe during that briefing that the agents who interviewed Flynn did not believe he intentionally lied about his conversation with the Ambassador and that the Justice Department was unlikely to prosecute him for false statements made in that interview,<U+201D> the letter reads. <U+201C>In the months since then, the Special Counsel obtained a guilty plea from Lt. General Flynn for that precise alleged conduct,"" it adds. Grassley<U+2019>s letter requests transcripts of intercepted calls, any FBI summaries, the FBI agents notes of their interview with Flynn by May 25. It also requests an interview with one of the agents who conducted the interview with Flynn. Grassley says that due to the guilty plea, <U+201C>the Committee<U+2019>s oversight interest in the underlying documents requested more than a year ago now outweighs any legitimate executive branch interest in withholding it.<U+201D><U+00A0> <U+201C>So too does the Committee<U+2019>s interest in learning the FBI agents<U+2019> actual assessments of their interview of Lt. Gen. Flynn, particularly given the apparent contradiction between what then-Directory Comey told us in March 2017 and what he now claims,<U+201D> he says. The request comes as Trump and other Republicans are increasingly raising their voices about what they see as a politically-motivated probe by Mueller. <U+201C>The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait <U+2018>till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!<U+201D> Trump tweeted on Monday. He also asked if the probe was being lengthened so as to impact the midterms in November. <U+201C>Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!<U+201D> he tweeted.

John McCain, according to several sources familiar with the meeting.  In discussing McCain's opposition to CIA nominee Gina Haspel, Sadler, a special assistant who handles surrogate communications for the White House, said in a private meeting Thursday that it doesn't matter ""because he's dying anyway."" It was a joke that fell flat, a White House official told CNN. Despite publicly refusing to criticize the remark, Sanders told the press staff that Sadler's comment was inappropriate, according to several sources familiar with the meeting. During the dressing down, Sanders focused more on how the remark was leaked apparently in an attempt to target Sadler with a damaging story, one of the sources told CNN. White House strategic communications director Mercedes Schlapp spoke up during the session to defend Sadler, one of the sources said.   Both publicly and privately, according to the sources, Sanders has focused more on the leaking of the comment than its substance. In Friday's White House press briefing, Sanders repeatedly said she would not ""validate a leak"" or comment on an internal staff meeting. Asked directly why not simply apologize to McCain, who was diagnosed with brain cancer, and his family, she said: ""I'm not going to get into a back and forth because people want to create issues of leaked staff meetings."" Sadler is still employed at the White House, Sanders said Friday.  Responding Saturday to the controversial comments, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called Sadler's remarks a ""disgusting thing to say"" and said he was dissatisfied with the administration's response to the controversy.  ""If it was a joke, it was a terrible joke,"" Graham, who is close friends with McCain and visited him in Arizona this week, told ""Face the Nation"" moderator Margaret Brennan in an excerpt of an interview set to air Sunday. ""I just wish somebody from the White House would tell the country that was inappropriate, that's not who we are in the Trump administration."" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney pushed back Saturday on calls to fire the aide, saying the purported joke about McCain's health was ""awful"" but not worth firing her over.  ""You have to have freedom to speak in a private meeting, to speak candidly,"" Mulvaney said Saturday on Fox News. ""We've all said things in private, especially in smaller groups that we work with, that we would never say publicly."" Echoing Sanders' private comments to staffers, Mulvaney said the leak was designed to hurt Sadler and ""completely ignored the harm it would do to the McCain family, which is doubly inconsiderate."" ""I'm really disappointed that someone would undermine the President by leaking that out of a private meeting,"" he said, adding that he, as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, was not present at the meeting in which Sadler made the remark. After her comment was reported Thursday, Sadler called Meghan McCain, the senator's daughter, to apologize for the remark, a source close to the situation told CNN. Mulvaney told Fox News that in doing so, Sadler handled the situation ""appropriately."" However, on ""The View"" Friday, McCain questioned how Sadler still had her job.  CNN's Abby Phillip contributed to this report."
